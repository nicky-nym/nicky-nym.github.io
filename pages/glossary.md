* **charter city**
  * a special jurisdiction with a blank slate in commercial law, to allow for the adoption of new practices in areas such as a business registration, labor law, tax administration, and commercial dispute resolution
  * _typically built on greenfield sites to avoid the challenges of implementing such a wide array of reforms in an existing polity_
  * _typically privately financed_

* **Community Land Trust (CLT)**
  * A nonprofit organization that owns land and sells or rents housing units (or retail or office space) built on the land, usually with the goal of providing affordable housing. A household typically leases a unit for a 99-year term, rather than buying a house outright, or may buy a house outright but leases the land that the house built on. Members elect a board so that the CLT is democratically self-governing. When a member sells a unit, the CLT may collect a cut of the sales price (in practice, as high as 75%), which it can use to subside purchases for new homeowners. [^schneider_2019-04-29]
