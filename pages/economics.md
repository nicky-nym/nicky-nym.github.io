# Land Value

## New York land value

* from 1950 to 2015, the value of Manhattan land grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent beyond inflation[^manhattan]

> "Corner lots are significantly more valuable than mid-block lots, according to the study, and lots in close proximity to Broadway, which runs the length of the island, also have higher values."[^manhattan]


## Economic potential

If you're building a new city, or if you have a city that's likely to grow to have 10 million people, then the real estate in the city will end up being worth a lot of money. The investors and real estate developers will want to maximize what that real estate ends up being worth.

How much the real estate is worth will depend on where in the world it is, what sort of work people there are doing, etc. But independent of those things like GDP per capita, the real estate value will still be proportional to kinematic range. If you can improve the kinematic range, you can improve the real estate value.

I'm not suggesting that you could somehow re-build the San Francisco Bay Area into a kinematic city, but I am saying that hypothetically, *if* the Bay Area had been built kinematically, then the residential real estate would be worth $1.7 trillion instead of the current $1.3 trillion.

So, in the case of the SF Bay Area, there's $400 billion in residential real estate value that somehow got left on the table, plus a comparable amount for commercial real estate, plus the lost value of the land taken up by roads, which would also be worth hundreds of billions if the roads were all replaced with four-story sheltered bikeway builidings. In total, that's something over a trillion dollars of lost value, just because of past choices about streets, geometry, and buildings.

In Asia and Africa the numbers would be smaller just because the GDP per capita is less, but the numbers are still huge. If the world has another 2.5 billion people moving into cities in the next 30 years, then we should think twice about how much prosperity we want to leave on the table. Real estate developers who care about the value of their land should care about building kinematically.

And it's not just real estate. It's also GDP per capita, and hourly wages. So, if you're a government that collects income taxes, you should also care. And it's also patents per capita, so institutions like a government Department of Defense might also care.

Our current cities are sub-optimal to the extent that there's hundred of billions of dollars of lost value per major city. Anyone, or any coalition, who can optimize on that can begin to harvest that windfall. In practice, the windfall would get split up between lots of different parties, so that there would be enough incentives to go around. 

There would be:

  + **company founders**, with early equity stakes in the companies involved
  + **inventors**, getting royalties on patents for, say, new spatial layouts
  + **architects** getting licensing fees on blueprints & construction specs
  + **property managers**, getting lease and rent income
  + previous **land-owners**, profiting on the sale of land to the new city
  + **real estate developers**, getting property value appreciation
  + **anchor employers**, getting tax incentives & incentive investments
  + **new employees**, getting big relocation bonuses & brand new housing
  + **early homeowners**, getting in the ground floor on property values
  + **county governments**, getting new property tax revenue
  + **state governments**, getting new income tax revenue
  + **local airports**, getting new flights & additional passenger revenue
  + etc.
