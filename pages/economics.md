## Hong Kong

All the land within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, with the single exception of St. John's Cathedral, is owned by the government, and has been since 1843.

## GDP

> "With the right framework, astonishing prosperity is possible. The independent city of Singapore overtook the world’s GDP per capita in less than 30 years, and that of the USA in less than 50 years." [^free-private-cities]

> "Cities generate roughly 80% of global GDP and are home to more than half of the world's population today, a share that the United Nations projects will reach two-thirds by 2050," the report said. About 40% of the population lives within 100 kilometers of a coast, and one in 10 people live in areas less than 10 meters above sea level, it said. [^khan]

## <a name="construction-costs"></a>Construction costs

> "the price of construction for an apartment fully equipped with kitchen and bathrooms may cost several thousand US dollars per square meter (about US$2,500 per square meter in New York in 2013 for residential buildings three to seven stories tall)."[^bertaud]

> "In the lowest-income countries, where construction is the cheapest, households would need to be able to afford at least US$6,000 for a studio of 12 square meters; US$6,000 is the global market commodity price for the basic construction materials of concrete and steel required to build 12 square meters."[^bertaud]

> "San Francisco has the world's second-highest construction costs... The city's average construction costs of $330 per square foot was second only to New York, according to a study last year by Turner and Townsend, a construction consultant. Apartments cost around $425,000 per unit to build." [^li]

> "New York and San Francisco topped the list of the most expensive construction markets, costing respectively an average of $354 and $330 per square foot to build. Seattle, which faces many of the same labor market and housing supply pressures as San Francisco, came in at $280 per square foot."[^reid]

## Bootstrapping

TODO: The chicken-and-egg problem.

## Land Value

### New York land value

> "At 305 square miles, New York City makes up only 0.008% of the total land area of the U.S., yet its $1.5tr of housing value is about 5% of the Nation-wide total. Only four states are worth more than New York City, one of which is New York State."[^metrocosm]

> "Manhattan‘s housing alone is worth about $733bn, which would make it the 14th most valuable state in the country. Manhattan measures only about 20 square miles, 7.5% of New York City."[^metrocosm]

> "What I found most striking of all was the value of some Manhattan neighborhoods. The Upper East Side, which occupies less than one square mile, has an astounding $96bn of housing value. That places it above Staten Island and the Bronx as well as above six states: New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and Alaska."[^metrocosm]

* from 1950 to 2015, the value of Manhattan land grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent beyond inflation[^manhattan]

> "The developable land in Manhattan—excluding parks, roads, and highways—was worth between $1.54 and $1.95 trillion, for an average of $1.74 trillion"[^manhattan]

> "Corner lots are significantly more valuable than mid-block lots, according to the study, and lots in close proximity to Broadway, which runs the length of the island, also have higher values."[^manhattan]

### San Francisco land value

> "The San Francisco metro area [the counties of San Francisco, Alameda, Marin, Contra Costa, and San Mateo] is the third most valuable region in America based on the value of its residential real estate. The area's total residential real estate value hit an astonishing $1.3 trillion and it's outranked only by the Los Angeles and New York metro areas, with total residential real estate values of $2.2 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively." ... "San Francisco is one of three cities nationwide that can claim a market value higher than Apple Inc.'s $1 trillion."[^hoeven]


### African land value

> In Africa "we should be building 40 million new homes or 160 Atlantas every year. ... 
> Africa has 54 countries. Altogether they do not build 1 million homes a year. 
> The gap is the opportunity. 40 million modest homes require an investment of 
> more than $1 trillion every year. The multiplier effects would add $10 trillion 
> to annual GDP. That is 5 times current GDP. Closing Africa’s housing gap can 
> generate 5 times current GDP!"
> &mdash; Paul Musembwa, CEO of Warp Developments

## Economic potential

I'm not suggesting that you can suddenly create a trillion dollars just by building a new city for 10 million people.

But, here's what I am suggesting -- if you're building a new city, or if you have a city that's likely to grow to have 10 million people, then the real estate in the city will end up being worth a lot of money. The investors and real estate developers will want to maximize what that real estate ends up being worth.

How much the real estate is worth will depend on where in the world it is, what sort of work people there are doing, etc. But independent of those things like GDP per capita, the real estate value will still be proportional to kinematic range. If you can improve the kinematic range, you can improve the real estate value.

I'm not suggesting that you could somehow re-build the San Francisco Bay Area into a kinematic city, but I am saying that hypothetically, *if* the Bay Area had been built kinematically, then the residential real estate would be worth $1.7 trillion instead of the current $1.3 trillion.

So, in the case of the SF Bay Area, there's $400 billion in residential real estate value that somehow got left on the table, plus a comparable amount for commercial real estate, plus the lost value of the land taken up by roads, which would also be worth hundreds of billions if the roads were all replaced with four-story sheltered bikeway builidings. In total, that's something over a trillion dollars of lost value, just because of past choices about streets, geometry, and buildings.

In Asia and Africa the numbers would be smaller just because the GDP per capita is less, but the numbers are still huge. If the world has another 2.5 billion people moving into cities in the next 30 years, then we should think twice about how much prosperity we want to leave on the table. Real estate developers who care about the value of their land should care about building kinematically.

And it's not just real estate. It's also GDP per capita, and hourly wages. So, if you're a government that collects income taxes, you should also care. And it's also patents per capita, so institutions like a government Department of Defense might also care.

Our current cities are sub-optimal to the extent that there's hundred of billions of dollars of lost value per major city. Anyone, or any coalition, who can optimize on that can begin to harvest that windfall. In practice, the windfall would get split up between lots of different parties, so that there would be enough incentives to go around. 

There would be:

  + **company founders**, with early equity stakes in the companies involved
  + **inventors**, getting royalties on patents for, say, new spatial layouts
  + **architects** getting licensing fees on blueprints & construction specs
  + **property managers**, getting lease and rent income
  + previous **land-owners**, profiting on the sale of land to the new city
  + **real estate developers**, getting property value appreciation
  + **anchor employers**, getting tax incentives & incentive investments
  + **new employees**, getting big relocation bonuses & brand new housing
  + **early homeowners**, getting in the ground floor on property values
  + **county governments**, getting new property tax revenue
  + **state governments**, getting new income tax revenue
  + **local airports**, getting new flights & additional passenger revenue
  + etc.

They're projecting that 2.5 billion people will be moving to cities in the next 30 years. Over the next 40 years, the newly built floor area in the world is expected to double. There may or may not be trillions of dollars of value to capture, but there probably will be hundreds of billions.


## The "big bet" approach vs. incrementalism

Although both approaches have huge hurdles, I do think the Big Bet approach is actually the "leaner" option (faster & cheaper). In the Big Bet approach, you don't actually have to build a huge new city over night. You just have to
  * buy a huge amount of land on day one, and 
  * zone it all so that it can grow in a kinematic shape (without getting clogged up with junk like traffic lights), and 
  * find an "anchor employer" (like Amazon or Apple) to open their new headquarters there, or convince a government to build their new capital there.

## Minimum viable Kinematic city

A minimum viable start would need:

  + a city charter (the legal documents)
  + an independent city government
  + one or more corporate real estate development partners
  + tens of square miles of fairly empty, but not remote, real estate
  + one or more existing local construction companies
  + whole-hearted support from existing county & state governments
  + a big anchor employer (like Amazon, or the Indonesian Government)
  + an existing airport, port, and interstate highway not too far away
  + start-up capital:
    - billions of dollars (in Africa)
    - or tens of billions (in the US)
  + a few years of time, for initial construction work, to build:
    - enough housing and office space for tens of thousand of people
    - covered laneways for vehicle circulation
    - a power grid
    - water supply
    - a sanitation system
    - other minimum basic infrastructure

## Land Value Created vs. Land Value Capture

https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/why-more-big-cities-should-give-value-capture-a-chance-b9c4cfac9768

(That article gives examples in New York and California. It quantifies a lot of *value created*, and talks less about "value capture", which perhaps is the harder part of the problem.

One of the interesting things the article does mention is that "despite this potential ... value capture ... doesn't work in areas that are already developed. ... undeveloped area provide the most room for growth."  

That seems to get a the crux of the problem: the place we really need better mobility is in existing big cities, but those are the places where all the land is already privately owned.


## Land Value Capture

_Under What Circumstances Will Land Value Capture Work to Finance Public Transit?_, by Yidan Xu, May 2015

"Based on the studies in Asian countries including China, Singapore and South Korea, public transportation generally has a positive impact on property values, and the impact is closely related with distance to the station. On average, property value will decrease by 1% if the distance from a transport station is increased by 10% (Cervero & Murakami, 2009)."[^xu]

"Bartholomew and Ewing’s (2010) study indicates transit accessibility, walkability, and environment quality can be capitalized into real estate prices. The existence of high walkability and mixed land use types are likely to increase land values independent of transit accessibility."[^xu]

"Other factors related to the value generated from public transportation include the service quality, the extent of network, and the ticket price. Andersson (2010) conducted a research about the high speed rail in Taiwan, and finds out that it has little impact on land values due to the high ticket price (A monthly ticket can take up to 70% of the median monthly wage in Taiwan). It is difficult to capitalize expensive services into land values."[^xu]

"In most studies, proximity to transport stations has a positive correlation to land value. They can generate property value premiums ranging from 3% to 40% in different conditions (Medda, 2012)."[^xu]

"Value capture is a way to generate revenue by recouping a portion of the gains in the value of land that result from improvements of public transportation. ...
Common value capture mechanisms include:"[^xu]
~ Leasing development rights or selling land. (e.g. Hong Kong)
~ Land Value Tax.
~ Tax Increment Financing (TIF). (e.g. New York)


"Hong Kong’s strategy can be applied in cities where government owns the land."[^xu]

"To conclude from the above literatures, value capture models are applicable to cities that have a good coordination of land use, city planning and economic development."[^xu]

"Second, it should be able to acquire land at a favorable price, which will minimize the cost and maximize the profit from future land transition."[^xu]


### Chapter 4 Rail Plus Property Program in Hong Kong

"Hong Kong’s public transit development method, which is well known as a distinctive example of transit value capture. ... Hong Kong is one of the few cities in the world where public transport makes a profit."[^xu]

"Hong Kong is a small island city with an area of 1104 square kilometers. To date, the city has a population of 7.1 million, and is projected to reach 8.6 million by 2026 (HK Census and Statistics Department, 2014)."[^xu]

"In terms of land attribute, all land in Hong Kong is state property and the only land tenure is leasehold. The government of Hong Kong is responsible for land management, development, and its lease to private entities, based on China’s Basic Law passed in 1990. Private developers bid to lease land with a general 50 years term."[^xu]

"The state leasehold system captures value from four major aspects: initial land auction, lease modification, lease renewal, and land rent collection. Among the four, initial land auction has been the major source of lease revenue, accounting for about 75 percent of government’s total land income (Hong, 1998)."[^xu]

"During the whole process, MTR is functioning as the master planner. It creates a development layout plan, monitors development quality, and manages the lease and sales of completed properties. It is a bridge between the government and developers. It sets clear rules to multiple stakeholders, making the partnership smooth and efficient."[^xu]

"One reason that projects like Tsing Yi Station come into success is that the land use integration is evaluated at the master planning stage by MTR (Tang, Chiang, Baldwin & Yeung, 2004). This magnifies the interaction between railway and property development."[^xu]

"Zoning regulations allow special FARs in key station areas to attract private investments and comprehensive development."[^xu]


### Chapter 7 Conclusion

"Thirdly, the planning of public transportation requires multiple levels of government and agencies to work together. It is important to form a good collaboration between the different development stages, including land acquisition, planning, construction, operation, and property management. In Hong Kong, for example, MTR as a single agency is responsible for the whole development cycle. The process is more efficient, because it saves additional administrative cost, and there is only one principle from beginning to end. For New York, however, as MTA is only responsible for railway construction and operation, and it has no right of land use, the capability of capturing land value is to some extent undermined."[^xu]

* **charter city**
  * a special jurisdiction with a blank slate in commercial law, to allow for the adoption of new practices in areas such as a business registration, labor law, tax administration, and commercial dispute resolution
  * _typically built on greenfield sites to avoid the challenges of implementing such a wide array of reforms in an existing polity_
  * _typically privately financed_
  * see: special economic zone

* **Community Land Trust (CLT)**
  * A nonprofit organization that owns land and sells or rents housing units (or retail or office space) built on the land, usually with the goal of providing affordable housing. A household typically leases a unit for a 99-year term, rather than buying a house outright, or may buy a house outright but leases the land that the house built on. Members elect a board so that the CLT is democratically self-governing. When a member sells a unit, the CLT may collect a cut of the sales price (in practice, as high as 75%), which it can use to subside purchases for new homeowners. [^schneider_2019-04-29]

* **effective altruism**
  * using empirical analysis to direct resources towards efforts that do the most possible good
  * _anti-malaria efforts, deworming initiatives, and direct cash transfer programs are among the interventions most widely credited with providing the most cost-effective improvement in welfare for the global poor than any other intervention_
