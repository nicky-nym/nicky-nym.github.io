## Land Value Capture

_Under What Circumstances Will Land Value Capture Work to Finance Public Transit?_, by Yidan Xu, May 2015

"Based on the studies in Asian countries including China, Singapore and South Korea, public transportation generally has a positive impact on property values, and the impact is closely related with distance to the station. On average, property value will decrease by 1% if the distance from a transport station is increased by 10% (Cervero & Murakami, 2009)."[^xu]

"Bartholomew and Ewing’s (2010) study indicates transit accessibility, walkability, and environment quality can be capitalized into real estate prices. The existence of high walkability and mixed land use types are likely to increase land values independent of transit accessibility."[^xu]

"Other factors related to the value generated from public transportation include the service quality, the extent of network, and the ticket price. Andersson (2010) conducted a research about the high speed rail in Taiwan, and finds out that it has little impact on land values due to the high ticket price (A monthly ticket can take up to 70% of the median monthly wage in Taiwan). It is difficult to capitalize expensive services into land values."[^xu]

"In most studies, proximity to transport stations has a positive correlation to land value. They can generate property value premiums ranging from 3% to 40% in different conditions (Medda, 2012)."[^xu]

"Value capture is a way to generate revenue by recouping a portion of the gains in the value of land that result from improvements of public transportation. ...
Common value capture mechanisms include:"[^xu]
~ Leasing development rights or selling land. (e.g. Hong Kong)
~ Land Value Tax.
~ Tax Increment Financing (TIF). (e.g. New York)


"Hong Kong’s strategy can be applied in cities where government owns the land."[^xu]

"To conclude from the above literatures, value capture models are applicable to cities that have a good coordination of land use, city planning and economic development."[^xu]

"Second, it should be able to acquire land at a favorable price, which will minimize the cost and maximize the profit from future land transition."[^xu]


### Chapter 4 Rail Plus Property Program in Hong Kong

"Hong Kong’s public transit development method, which is well known as a distinctive example of transit value capture. ... Hong Kong is one of the few cities in the world where public transport makes a profit."[^xu]

"Hong Kong is a small island city with an area of 1104 square kilometers. To date, the city has a population of 7.1 million, and is projected to reach 8.6 million by 2026 (HK Census and Statistics Department, 2014)."[^xu]

"In terms of land attribute, all land in Hong Kong is state property and the only land tenure is leasehold. The government of Hong Kong is responsible for land management, development, and its lease to private entities, based on China’s Basic Law passed in 1990. Private developers bid to lease land with a general 50 years term."[^xu]

"The state leasehold system captures value from four major aspects: initial land auction, lease modification, lease renewal, and land rent collection. Among the four, initial land auction has been the major source of lease revenue, accounting for about 75 percent of government’s total land income (Hong, 1998)."[^xu]

"During the whole process, MTR is functioning as the master planner. It creates a development layout plan, monitors development quality, and manages the lease and sales of completed properties. It is a bridge between the government and developers. It sets clear rules to multiple stakeholders, making the partnership smooth and efficient."[^xu]

"One reason that projects like Tsing Yi Station come into success is that the land use integration is evaluated at the master planning stage by MTR (Tang, Chiang, Baldwin & Yeung, 2004). This magnifies the interaction between railway and property development."[^xu]

"Zoning regulations allow special FARs in key station areas to attract private investments and comprehensive development."[^xu]


### Chapter 7 Conclusion

"Thirdly, the planning of public transportation requires multiple levels of government and agencies to work together. It is important to form a good collaboration between the different development stages, including land acquisition, planning, construction, operation, and property management. In Hong Kong, for example, MTR as a single agency is responsible for the whole development cycle. The process is more efficient, because it saves additional administrative cost, and there is only one principle from beginning to end. For New York, however, as MTA is only responsible for railway construction and operation, and it has no right of land use, the capability of capturing land value is to some extent undermined."[^xu]
