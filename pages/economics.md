## Hong Kong

All the land within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, with the single exception of St. John's Cathedral, is owned by the government, and has been since 1843.


## GDP

## Land Value

### New York land value

> "At 305 square miles, New York City makes up only 0.008% of the total land area of the U.S., yet its $1.5tr of housing value is about 5% of the Nation-wide total. Only four states are worth more than New York City, one of which is New York State."[^metrocosm]

> "Manhattan‘s housing alone is worth about $733bn, which would make it the 14th most valuable state in the country. Manhattan measures only about 20 square miles, 7.5% of New York City."[^metrocosm]

> "What I found most striking of all was the value of some Manhattan neighborhoods. The Upper East Side, which occupies less than one square mile, has an astounding $96bn of housing value. That places it above Staten Island and the Bronx as well as above six states: New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and Alaska."[^metrocosm]

* from 1950 to 2015, the value of Manhattan land grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent beyond inflation[^manhattan]

> "The developable land in Manhattan—excluding parks, roads, and highways—was worth between $1.54 and $1.95 trillion, for an average of $1.74 trillion"[^manhattan]

> "Corner lots are significantly more valuable than mid-block lots, according to the study, and lots in close proximity to Broadway, which runs the length of the island, also have higher values."[^manhattan]


## Economic potential

I'm not suggesting that you can suddenly create a trillion dollars just by building a new city for 10 million people.

But, here's what I am suggesting -- if you're building a new city, or if you have a city that's likely to grow to have 10 million people, then the real estate in the city will end up being worth a lot of money. The investors and real estate developers will want to maximize what that real estate ends up being worth.

How much the real estate is worth will depend on where in the world it is, what sort of work people there are doing, etc. But independent of those things like GDP per capita, the real estate value will still be proportional to kinematic range. If you can improve the kinematic range, you can improve the real estate value.

I'm not suggesting that you could somehow re-build the San Francisco Bay Area into a kinematic city, but I am saying that hypothetically, *if* the Bay Area had been built kinematically, then the residential real estate would be worth $1.7 trillion instead of the current $1.3 trillion.

So, in the case of the SF Bay Area, there's $400 billion in residential real estate value that somehow got left on the table, plus a comparable amount for commercial real estate, plus the lost value of the land taken up by roads, which would also be worth hundreds of billions if the roads were all replaced with four-story sheltered bikeway builidings. In total, that's something over a trillion dollars of lost value, just because of past choices about streets, geometry, and buildings.

In Asia and Africa the numbers would be smaller just because the GDP per capita is less, but the numbers are still huge. If the world has another 2.5 billion people moving into cities in the next 30 years, then we should think twice about how much prosperity we want to leave on the table. Real estate developers who care about the value of their land should care about building kinematically.

And it's not just real estate. It's also GDP per capita, and hourly wages. So, if you're a government that collects income taxes, you should also care. And it's also patents per capita, so institutions like a government Department of Defense might also care.

Our current cities are sub-optimal to the extent that there's hundred of billions of dollars of lost value per major city. Anyone, or any coalition, who can optimize on that can begin to harvest that windfall. In practice, the windfall would get split up between lots of different parties, so that there would be enough incentives to go around. 

There would be:

  + **company founders**, with early equity stakes in the companies involved
  + **inventors**, getting royalties on patents for, say, new spatial layouts
  + **architects** getting licensing fees on blueprints & construction specs
  + **property managers**, getting lease and rent income
  + previous **land-owners**, profiting on the sale of land to the new city
  + **real estate developers**, getting property value appreciation
  + **anchor employers**, getting tax incentives & incentive investments
  + **new employees**, getting big relocation bonuses & brand new housing
  + **early homeowners**, getting in the ground floor on property values
  + **county governments**, getting new property tax revenue
  + **state governments**, getting new income tax revenue
  + **local airports**, getting new flights & additional passenger revenue
  + etc.

They're projecting that 2.5 billion people will be moving to cities in the next 30 years. Over the next 40 years, the newly built floor area in the world is expected to double. There may or may not be trillions of dollars of value to capture, but there probably will be hundreds of billions.


## The "big bet" approach vs. incrementalism

Although both approaches have huge hurdles, I do think the Big Bet approach is actually the "leaner" option (faster & cheaper). In the Big Bet approach, you don't actually have to build a huge new city over night. You just have to
  * buy a huge amount of land on day one, and 
  * zone it all so that it can grow in a kinematic shape (without getting clogged up with junk like traffic lights), and 
  * find an "anchor employer" (like Amazon or Apple) to open their new headquarters there, or convince a government to build their new capital there.



## Land Value Capture

_Under What Circumstances Will Land Value Capture Work to Finance Public Transit?_, by Yidan Xu, May 2015

"Bartholomew and Ewing’s (2010) study indicates transit accessibility, walkability, and environment quality can be capitalized into real estate prices. The existence of high walkability and mixed land use types are likely to increase land values independent of transit accessibility."[^xu]

"Other factors related to the value generated from public transportation include the service quality, the extent of network, and the ticket price. Andersson (2010) conducted a research about the high speed rail in Taiwan, and finds out that it has little impact on land values due to the high ticket price (A monthly ticket can take up to 70% of the median monthly wage in Taiwan). It is difficult to capitalize expensive services into land values."[^xu]


### Chapter 4 Rail Plus Property Program in Hong Kong

"Hong Kong is a small island city with an area of 1104 square kilometers. To date, the city has a population of 7.1 million, and is projected to reach 8.6 million by 2026 (HK Census and Statistics Department, 2014)."[^xu]



"Zoning regulations allow special FARs in key station areas to attract private investments and comprehensive development."[^xu]
