## <a name="what_is"></a>What is a Kinematic city?

  * A **congested** city is one where it's hard to get where you want to go, because there's too much traffic.
  * A **sleepy** little town is one where there's no traffic, but there's almost nothing in town to go to.
  * A **kinematic** city is one that has lots of destinations **and** they're all easy to get to.

### <a name="kinematic_range"></a>Kinematic range

  * **Kinematic range** is a measure of urban mobility. It's the number of destinations you can get to in 30 minutes or less* _(*or some other set time)_.
  * Different cities have different kinematic ranges
    * In **Haxby, Montana**, there's not any traffic congestion, but there also aren't many places to go. With a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach a total of about a half dozen homes, with perhaps 10 thousand square feet of floorspace.
    * In **San Francsico**, there are lots of places to go, but there's a lot of congestion. In 30 minutes you can reach hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and stores, with perhaps a 500 million square feet of floorspace.  San Francisco has a kinematic range that's about 50 thousand times larger than Haxby, Montana.

## <a name="who_cares"></a>Why does Kinematic Range matter?

  * Urban mobility is *important*
  * *For people*, having more destinations within reach means:
    * more *job offers* that are close enough to commute to
    * more *friends* and *family* who are actually close enough to drop by
    * more *schools* to choose from, and more *special classes*
    * more *doctors* to choose from, and more different *specialists* available
    * a wider variety of *churches* and *religious communities*
    * a wider variety of *events*, *meetups*, and *clubs*, and more people who share your interests
    * a wider variety of *"long tail"* destinations
  * *For shops*, *employers*, and *industry*, it means:
    * more *job candidates* to choose from
    * more *vendors* and *parts suppliers* to choose from
    * more *contractors* in different *specialized fields*
    * more *"industrial agglomeration"*, which leads to *"agglomeration economies"* (somewhat similar to the separate idea of "economies of scale")
  * *For 911 calls* to first responders, it means:
    * *faster response times* and *better incident outcomes*

## <a name="why"></a>How do existing cities try to become more Kinematic?

Cities try to improve kinematic range

  * *public transit projects*
    * the *2nd Avenue Subway* project in *New York*, 
    * the *Transbay Transit Center* in *San Francisco*, 
  * *more highways*, or *more lanes*
    * the *Big Dig* in *Boston*, 
  * *more throughput per lane*
    * the *HOV Carpool Lanes* in *Los Angeles*, 
    * the *congestion pricing* in ...

### <a name="size"></a>Size & density

  * **Bigger may not be better.** Big cities, with more people, have more destinations to go to, and have a wider variety of destinatations. But, if there's too much congestion, it may take too long to get to the other side of town, so that limits your kinematic range. Your range doesn't cover the whole city, just the region of the city that's within 30 minutes of you.
  * **Denser may not be better.** New York is much denser than Los Angeles, so there are more destinations per square mile in New York than there are in Los Angeles. But it takes longer to travel 10 miles in New York than in does in Los Angeles, so Los Angeles actually has a larger kinematic range than New York.

## <a name="why"></a>Why would we want Kinematic cities?

## <a name="cost"></a>How much would it cost?

  * **The same as a regular city**
    * Construction costs, per square foot, would be about the same for buildings in a kinematic city as buildings in a regular city.
    * In a region with high construction costs, like California, constructing buildings in a kinematic city would be just as expensive as constructing buildings in other cities.
    * In places with lower construction costs, like the UAE, or China, constructing buildings in a kinematic city would cost about the same as building any other building. 
    
  * **Maybe slightly cheaper**
    * The simplest sorts of kinematic city designs could entirely omit some of the expensive transit systems found in conventional cities, such as subway systems and light rail. 
    * A simple kinematic city designs could also be composed entirely of mid-rise buildings, which are cheaper to build, per square foot, than either high-rise or low-rise buildings.

## <a name="rules_of_thumb"></a>Rules of thumb

  * **People tend to travel about one hour a day.**
    * For people who commute, the average commute is about 30 minutes each way.
    * For people who arenâ€™t commuting, it is common to spend about an hour each day on other sorts of trips: chores, errands, appointments, etc.
    * This "one hour per day" number has been found to be surprisingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. This is called the **Marchetti constant** (named for Cesare Marchetti, although it was really Yacov Zahavi who first wrote about it).
  * **Some aspects of a city scale linearly.**
    * If a city doubles in population size, many measurable characteristics of the city, such as the number of businesses, also double in size. Around the world, from small towns to big cities, regardless of the size of city, there's always about one business establishment per 22 people, and an average of about 8 employees for each establishment.
  * **Some aspects of a city scale sub-linearly.**
    * There are often economies of scale in the infrastructure of big cities (or at least, economies of density). 
    * If a city doubles in population size, meaning it grows by 100%, parts of the supporting infrastructure tend to only grow by 85%. This is tends to be true for networks of roads, electrical cables, and municipal sewers and water pipes.
  * **Some aspects of a city scale super-linearly.**
    *
