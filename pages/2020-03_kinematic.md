## <a name="what"></a>What is a Kinematic city?

  * A **congested** city is a city where it's hard to get where you want to go, because there's too much traffic.
  * A **sleepy** little town is a town where there's no traffic, but there's almost nothing in town to go to.
  * A **kinematic** city is a city that has lots of destinations **and** they're all easy to get to.

### <a name="kinematic_range"></a>Kinematic range

  * **Kinematic range** is a measure of urban mobility. It's the number of destinations you can get to in 30 minutes or less* (*or some other set time).
  * Different cities have different kinematic ranges
    * In **Haxby, Montana**, there's not any traffic congestion, but there also aren't many places to go. With a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach a total of about a half dozen homes, with perhaps 10 thousand square feet of floorspace.
    * In **San Francsico**, there are lots of places to go, but there's a lot of congestion. In 30 minutes you can reach hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and stores, with perhaps a 500 million square feet of floorspace.  San Francisco has a kinematic range that's about 50 thousand times larger than Haxby, Montana.

### <a name="size"></a>Size & density

  * **Bigger may not be better.** Big cities, with more people, have more destinations to go to, and have a wider variety of destinatations. But, if there's too much congestion, it may take too long to get to the other side of town, so that limits your kinematic range. Your range doesn't cover the whole city, just the region of the city that's within 30 minutes of you.
  * **Denser may not be better.** New York is much denser than Los Angeles, so there are more destinations per square mile in New York than there are in Los Angeles. But it takes longer to travel 10 miles in New York than in does in Los Angeles, so Los Angeles actually has a larger kinematic range than New York.

## <a name="why"></a>Why would we want Kinematic cities?

  * Urban mobility is important. Having more destinations within reach means:
    * more job offers that are close enough to commute to
    * more friends and family who are actually close enough to drop by
    * more schools to choose from, and more special classes
    * more doctors to choose from, and more different specialists available
    * a wider variety of churches and religious communities
    * a wider variety of events, meetups, and clubs, and more people who share your interests
    * a wider variety of "long tail" destinations
    * for employers, more job candidates to choose from
    * for manufacturers, more vendors and parts suppliers to choose from
    * for businesses, more contractors in different specialized fields
    * for industries, more "industrial agglomeration", which leads to "agglomeration economies" (somewhat similar to the separate idea of "economies of scale")
    * for first responders, faster response times and better incident outcomes

## <a name="economics"></a>Economic realities

  * **People tend to travel about one hour a day.**
    * For people who commute, the average commute is about 30 minutes each way.
    * For people who arenâ€™t commuting, it is common to spend about an hour each day on other sorts of trips: chores, errands, appointments, etc.
    * This "one hour per day" number has been found to be surprisingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. This is called the **Marchetti constant** (named for Cesare Marchetti, although it was really Yacov Zahavi who first wrote about it).
  * **Some aspects of a city scale linearly.**
    * If a city doubles in population size, many measurable characteristics of the city, such as the number of businesses, also double in size. Around the world, from small towns to big cities, regardless of the size of city, there's always about one business establishment per 22 people, and an average of about 8 employees for each establishment.
  * **Some aspects of a city scale sub-linearly.**
    * There are often economies of scale in the infrastructure of big cities (or at least, economies of density). 
    * If a city doubles in population size, meaning it grows by 100%, parts of the supporting infrastructure tend to only grow by 85%. This is tends to be true for networks of roads, electrical cables, and municipal sewers and water pipes.
  * **Some aspects of a city scale super-linearly.**
    *
