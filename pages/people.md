> "The amount of floorspace in buildings around the world—currently about 2.5 trillion square feet—is set to double by 2060"
> &mdash; Brian Bienkowski [^bienkowski]

## <a name="need"></a>The world needs more urban floorspace

It is estimated that **by 2050**:
* about **2.5 billion additional people** will live in cities (vs. 2019), with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* **68% of the world's population** will be living in cities (vs. 55% in 2018)[^growth][^mason]
* about **200 million climate migrants** will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants]
* **400 million people in India** will migrate to cities[^sharma]
* the **African population will double** from 1.3 billion today to over **2.5 billion** [^forbes]
* there will be at least **nine African "megacities" of 10 million people or more** (and more than two dozen African cities of 5 million or more, about the size of metropolitan Washington), but currently 60 percent of Africa’s city dwellers live in slums [^bloomberg]
* one-third of all of the French Polynesian islands will be submerged[^fast-company]

In California alone, "to satisfy pent-up demand and meet the needs of a growing population, California needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2025."[^mckinsey]

> "Broadly speaking, there is no solution to the California housing crisis without the construction of millions of new houses," said David Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.[^buhayar]

> "The infrastructure here is really tapped," Zuckerberg said Thursday. "Housing prices are way up. Traffic is bad." He added that while Facebook is trying to do what it can to help with what he called the region’s policy challenges, "at this point we’re primarily growing outside of the Bay Area." ... The CEO said he prefers big hubs where Facebook engineering teams could be around one another, and that he doesn’t want to have a lot of small offices around the world, except for where sales teams need to be in the markets they’re serving.[^sumagaysay]

> "58 of the 89 biggest — with headquarters of 100,000 square feet and above — tech and life science companies based in the Bay Area have leased 30.4 million square feet of office space in other U.S. cities since January 2010"[^sumagaysay]


### Refugee numbers are increasing

"An estimated 2.4 billion people–40% of the world’s population–live in a coastal region and will likely be impacted by rising sea levels as a result of climate change."[^fast-company]

As of 2018, **70 million people** were currently displaced by war, persecution and conflict. Of the total, 51 million were Internally Displaced People (IDPs), and 26 million were refugees (including **13 million refugee children**). Most refugees live in towns and cities, not rural areas or refugee camps. Nearly 4 in every 5 refugees are in displacement situations that have lasted for at least five years.[^displaced]

> "Indonesia has already announced a $34 billion plan to move its sinking, flood-prone 30-million-person capital to higher ground"[^shepard]

> "There are billions of people living on coastlines that are going to be flooded. It’s going to be worse and worse and worse year by year and they are going to have to move eventually, and where are they going to move to? ... we're going to have to deal with that on a large scale" &mdash Dr. Tom Goreau, president of the Global Coral Reef Alliance.[^shepard]

> "it has been estimated that it’s going to cost the USA alone around $400 billion over the next two decades in sea level rise damage control"[^shepard]


### Greenfield city projects can help

> "We are at the beginning of the next wave of urbanization — a period of 
> rapid growth in both area and population... The next wave of urbanization 
> will also be defined by its sheer size — a tripling of land cover in the 
> first half of this century alone. While the carrying capacity of existing 
> cities is under increasing strain, unsustainable urban growth threatens to 
> outstrip any mitigation efforts in our urban cores. The result is a need 
> for new sites of politics, housing, commerce, industry, and energy. One 
> solution is the accelerating development of greenfield cities around the world. 
> Building new cities from the ground up is a bold (and monumentally difficult) 
> attempt to relieve the strain on our currently overloaded urban systems. It 
> promises to build energy efficiency, sustainability, and resilience in to the core of a place."[^caspar]
> &mdash; Caspar Herzberg, Schneider Electric


## <a name="tidal-wave"></a>Tidal wave

The current market size for new city construction is large:
  * in the next 30 years, **another 2.5 billion people** will live cities
  * "averaged over the next thirty-five years, about a million and a half people will be urbanized each week ... the equivalent of another New York metropolitan area [every two months]"[^scale]
  * **120 new cities** are currently being built, **in 40 countries**[^haas]
  * "China ... is on a fast track to build up to **three hundred new cities** each in excess of a million people over the next twenty to twenty-five years. ...  At the present rate it will be moving the equivalent of the entire U.S. population (more than 300 million people) to cities in the next twenty to twenty-five years."[^scale]
  * spending is somewhere between the high hundreds of billions of dollars, and the low trillions of dollars
  * real estate development projects now operate at a scale where it is possible to complete a coordinated, monolithic, **privately financed $10 billion construction project**

> "We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"[^growth] 
> &mdash; Paul Romer

> "This will be by far the largest migration of human beings to have ever taken place on the planet ... The resulting challenges to the availability of energy and resources and the enormous stress on the social fabric across the globe are mind-boggling ... and the timescales to address them are very short."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

> "The UN estimates that each year cities across the world will gain more than 72 million new residents."[^lutter]

> "India, for example, will be home to 7 cities with populations greater than 10 million residents by 2050."[^lutter]

> "projections show that Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, will reach 35 million residents by 2050."[^lutter]


## New cities vs. new suburbs & satellite cities vs. new apartments in existing cities

Perhaps existing cities will absorb nearly all of the 2.5 billion additional people who will live in cities by 2050, but in doing so some of their suburbs will essentially develop into big satellite cities of their own right, so the Kinematic city ideas are relevant for how new developments in those satellite cities are designed.

If 4% of the people did move to entirely new cities, that would be 100 million people in new cities. A single new kinematic city could "just" be 10 million people.

## <a name="precident"></a>People are undertaking to build "new cities"

More than **120 new cities** are currently being built in 40 nations around the world[^growth], and 11,000 new buildings are built every day, meaning **4 million new buildings a year** [^metabuild].

  * **Nkwashi**, in Zambia, being built by Thebe Investment Management, is expected to house up to 100,000 people.[^mason]
  * **Tatu City**, in Kenya, being built by Rendeavour, is planned for 150,000 residents.[^mason]
  * **Forest City**, in Malaysia (700,000 residents) 
  * **Enyimba Economic City**, in Nigeria (1.5 million residents)
  * and more than 100 others...

> "Neom is best described as a $500 billion ... plan for a 10,000 square mile area"[^lutter]

> "New Cairo, ... when completed, it could house as many as 5 million residents"[^lutter]

> "Forest City is a $100 billion new city development which will house 700,000 residents when completed. Forest city is a 5600-acre development."[^lutter]


## <a name="cost"></a>Greenfield development vs. retrofitting

> "when planned, built, and governed well, cities can be massive agents of positive change," ... "They can be catalysts for inclusion and powerhouses of equitable economic growth. They can help us protect the environment and limit climate change. That is why we need a new vision for urbanization." &mdash; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon [^totaro]

> "Our biggest urban problems today—growing inequality, rampant gentrification, housing unaffordability, and increasing segregation—all have roots in the staggering cost of urban land."[^manhattan]

Projects in existing cities can be staggeringly expensive.
  * **$4.5 billion** for the San Francisco **Transbay Transit Center & Salesforce Tower** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$17 billion** for the **2nd Avenue Subway** project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$20 billion** for the **Hudson Yards** project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$21 billion** for the **Big Dig** in Boston <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$23 billion** for the **Riyadh Metro** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$32 billion** to rebuild the **World Trade Center** in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

> "Retrofitting cities, where cities already exist, can be up to three times more expensive than planning for infrastructure in advance of settlement." [^haas]

> "only about a quarter of New York City's 472 subway stations are wheelchair accessible" ... "subway officials ... plan to add elevators at 70 stations in the next five years." ... "The Metropolitan Transportation Authority ... estimates that accessibility fixes will cost about $78 million per station." [^fitzsimmons]

Zoning restrictions in existing cities prevent any large-scale changes to their spatial layout.

> "Three-quarters of the residential land in Los Angeles is restricted to single-family homes, according to UrbanFootprint, software that helps government and businesses understand cities and urban markets. In San Jose, the figure is 94%." [^buhayar]

Building on a new empty, greenfield site is a lot less expensive than building in an existing city. New cities provide more space at lower cost per capita. New cities create value, and demand.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>


## <a name="funding"></a>There is some funding available for new cities

> "The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. 
> Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of **$100bn** (£78bn), 
> while the country’s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. 
> Malaysia's Forest City had its price initially pegged at **$100bn**, 
> while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking **$161bn**. Adding up the costs of 
> more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment 
> that can be measured in the **trillions of dollars**."[^growth]
> &mdash; Wade Shepard, author and columnist

> "An estimated $100 billion is being invested in new city projects across Africa; [the city of] Diamniadio alone will cost the Senegalese government an estimated $2 billion."[^haas]

> "Google pledged $1 billion to help create 15,000 homes in California."[^gopal]

> "Apple commits $2.5 billion to address California’s housing crisis and homelessness issues"[^perez]

> "South Sudan’s First Vice-President Taban Deng Gai said the government is working on a master plan for the proposed new capital city of Ramciel that will cost the nation 10 billion US dollars."[^tamazuj]

In 2019, U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for **$40 billion** in subsidies, grants, and loans for people in coastal communities who want to either move inland or elevate their homes.[^yang]

### Large private-sector projects

In the past, the truly large-scale new developments have all been done by governments, at least up to now. But until recently that was true for space exploration too. Times are changing.

The global banking and investment system is taking on larger private projects now, computers and the internet enable cheaper and faster R&D, recruiting, project management, etc. Global GDP gets bigger every year, and the world takes on new and bigger projects, both public and private.

Perhaps in the coming decades we'll see increasingly large private-sector real-estate developments. Or, in the public sector, perhaps we'll see some central planning efforts that are looking for big, cost-effective, high-impact solutions to giant housing shortages.

In recent decades we have begun to see the private sector take on very large scale projects, without government funding.

City Center, in Las Vegas, Nevada, is a good example
  * 17 million square feet of mixed use space
  * built in 4 years (2006 to 2010)
  * 100% privately financed, at a cost of **$11 billion** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Banks, real estate developers, and the construction industry are now operating at a level where they can coordinate the successful delivery of very large projects.

In the 2020s and 2030s, is will not be crazy to propose a $20 billion privately funded construction project. The project just needs to pencil out well, be low risk, and meet the needs of customers.

### Public-sector funding mechanisms

There are established public-sector mechanisms for funding development projects, such as Tax Increment Financing (TIF).

> "Portland, Oregon, currently dedicates about 40 percent of its TIF revenues to affordable housing. Over nine years, the program generated nearly **a quarter of a billion dollars for affordable housing**..."[^schneider]

> "The $6 billion Lincoln Yards development in Chicago ... stands to receive **$1.3 billion in TIF funding**"[^schneider]
