## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions


### <a name="could-we-build"></a>Could we build a kinematic city?

**Yes.** The kinematic city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

### <a name="could-we-transform"></a>Could we turn London or Paris into kinematic cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

### <a name="could-ideas-trickle-down"></a>Could kinematic ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the kinematic city designs, and make their cities incrementally more kinematic, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

### <a name="do-ideas-impact-democracy"></a>Do kinematic ideas impact democracy and governance?

**No.** The kinematic city designs are politically neutral. The designs are just about transportation systems and about the physical, spatial layout of the buildings in the city.

A kinematic city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a kinematic city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a kinematic city, and they would both be kinematic cities.

### Freight

> "urban planners historically focused on residential travel and personal behavior, failing to integrate the movement of goods into their planning." [^wenzel]



### HVAC

> "The simulations show that the cooling energy demand of the analyzed building in the Greater Accra region is 113.9 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 31% and 50% for the projected climates for 2030 and 2050, respectively. For the analyzed building in the Ashanti region, the cooling energy demand is 104.4 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 6% and 15% for the 2030 and 2050 climates, respectively." [^dodoo]

### Competitions

_Urban Environment Design_ (UED) Magazine's _Hebei International Urban Planning and Design Competition â€“ Xingdong New Area Urban Design International Master Competition_ [^stouhi]
