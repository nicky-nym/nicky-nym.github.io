## <a name="summary"></a>Summary

 1. We understand a lot about **[how cities work](#how-cities-work)**.
 
 1. We **[want better cities](#work-better)** for everyone.
 
 1. We can make **[better design choices](#design-choices)**, to make better-working cities.
 
 1. We can get **[better outcomes](#better-outcomes)**.

> "Studies have consistently linked city living with poorer mental health. For example, growing up in an urban environment is correlated with twice the risk of developing schizophrenia as growing up in the countryside."[^macdonald]

> "Mental health is almost uniformly worse in cities... that's just what the data shows," [Andreas] Meyer-Lindenberg says over the phone. "There isn't really a bright side to this."[^macdonald]

> "Meyer-Lindenberg is currently tracking how different parts of the city affect our mental wellbeing, using a technique called ecological momentary assessment, in which participants repeatedly report on the environment around them in real time. Various studies have suggested that nature – be that a tree or a park – has an important impact on people’s mental health."[^macdonald]

## <a name="proposal"></a>(1) The proposal for kinematic cities

The proposal here is that new cities that are build from scratch could be built as "kinematic cities". **"Kinematic city"** is a newly made-up name for a specific set of ideas about ways to design cities. No one has yet built a kinematic city. The design revolves around striving to maximize "kinematic range", meaning the number of destinations that are in the daily range of travel for everybody. 

 1. Kinematic cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's **mobility**, travel range, and opportunity, within the city.
 1. Improved urban mobility leads to significant economic improvements &mdash; in wages, GDP, patent applications per capita, etc.
 1. The improved mobility and travel range in the kinematic design results from unconventional design choices.
    * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
    * **[spatial layout choices](#spatial-layout)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps


### <a name="transportation"></a>(1.1) Transportation proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no cars** within city limits
    * no private cars
    * no taxis
    * no ubers, lyfts
    * no waymos and self-driving cars
  * **no rail** within city limits
    * no subways
    * no light rail
    * no trollies or trams
  * **nothing airborne** within city limits
    * no delivery drones
    * no helicopters
    * no gondolas
  * **nothing big**
    * no buses or bus rapid transit (BRT)
    * no trucks
    * no mass transit
  * **no gas engines** in vehicles
    * no motorcycles
  * **nothing fast**
    * no motorcycles
  * **no stops** &mdash; keep traffic flowing
    * no traffic lights
    * no stop signs
    * no large intersections
    * no personal rapid transit, pods, people movers, or things with fixed stops
  * **no freeways**, and no free roads

Instead, we have
  * <a name="bikeish"></a>**bike-sized vehicles**
    * restrictions
        > below 18 mph "pedestrians are more likely to survive being hit by a car than die, while at higher speeds the reverse is true" [^levinson]
        > "Small changes in speed have big impacts on fatality rates: a person is 70 percent more likely to be killed by a car moving at 30 mph versus 25 mph." [^ng]
    * mixed-use vehicles
      * Some people may own their own bikes, wheelchairs, or other vehicles, which they can park at home or in parking spaces at their destination.
      * Some people may choose not to own their own vehicles, and instead use vehicle rental services such as Mobike, Lime, Motivate, or JUMP Bikes.
      * Some people may choose to travel in pedicabs or other small vehicles that have a human driver or are self-driving.
    * Innovation is NOT REQUIRED
      * A kinematic city could be built today using off-the-shelf bikes and other vehicles purchased from amazon.com.
    * Innovation IS POSSIBLE &mdash; a kinematic city can incorporate new products as they emerge on the market, sush as
      * new models of electric bikes, scooters, etc.
      * scooters and bicycles that can autonomously reposition themselves from where they are left to where they are needed. (Companies like Tortoise and Uber are working on autonomous scooters.[^dickey])
      * small vehicles that are fully self-driving, like self-driving wheelchairs, go-karts, or other single-person vehicles
      * wireless charging stations at public parking spaces
      * automated congestion pricing
      * battery swapping services
  * **covered laneways**
    * rain-sheltered pedestrian sidewalks
    * rain-sheltered bike-sized lanes &mdash; 5-foot wide lanes, not 10' or 12' wide lines
  * **laneway tolls** & **parking tolls**
    * no tolls on laneways that aren't congested
    * highest tolls at rush-hour, or on busy laneways
    * tolls are per-minute, not per-mile (to prevent slow "street blimp" advertising vehicles)
    * free parking when space is ample
    * highest parking tolls in congested areas
  * common-carrier **delivery lockers**[^quirk]
    * package-delivery lockers, located along the laneways
    * shared by Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and anyone else who would like to use them

### <a name="spatial-layout"></a>(1.2) Spatial layout proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no highways**
  * **no roads** with lanes wide enough for cars and trucks
  * **no empty rooftops**
  * **no single-story buildings** such as ranch houses &mdash; (don't squander land area)
  * **no skyscrapers** and no high-rise residential buildings &mdash; (keep construction costs down)
  * **no private suburban lawns** 

Instead, we have: 
  * mid-rise buildings of about **six stories, similar to Paris**
  * **row-houses** and "walk-up" apartments
  * buildings spaced to avoid dark areas that would be far from windows and skylights &mdash; (keep lighting costs down)
  * buildings with ventilation chimneys &mdash; (keep HVAC costs down)
  * buildings with windows that open
  * a grid of **bike-sized boulevards**
    * rain-sheltered boulevards, each with four narrow bike-sized lanes, each 5 feet wide, plus shoulders
    * grade-separated intersections, so your entire commute has no stop signs or traffic lights
    * a grid of highline trails above the bike boulevards
  * city blocks of about 660 feet by 660 feet
  * about one iconic **landmark structure** per million people, inspired by examples such as:
    * the Eiffel Tower in Paris
    * St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow
    * Big Ben and the tower from the Palace of Westminster in London
    * the leaning tower of Pisa
    * the Space Needle in Seattle
    * the Tower Bridge in London
    * the Makkah Royal Clock Tower in Mecca
    * the Gateway Arch in St. Louis
    * Potola Palace in Lhasa, Tibet
    * Westminster Abbey in London
    * Le Mont-Saint Michel
    * the pyramids of Giza
    * Chateau Frontenac in Quebec


### <a name="ramp"></a>(1.3) Ramp proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no stairways**, no stairs, and no steps &mdash; (don't squander floor space)
  * **no elevators** &mdash; (at $100,000 or more each)
  * **no escalators**

The only way to go "upstairs" or "downstairs" in a kinematic city is by using
  * flights of **wheelchair ramps**
  * hallway ramps
  * sidewalk ramps
  * bike path ramps


### <a name="safety"></a>(1.4) Safety proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no gas lines**
  * **no telephone poles**
  * **no overhead power lines**

Instead, we have: 
  * **underground power lines**
  * **911 call response times averaging 3 to 4 minutes**
    > "Improvements in response time and medicine are responsible for about one-third of the reduction in fatality rates from crashes in the UK."[^levinson]

#### Innovation NOT REQUIRED for emergency response

The city boulevards are wide enough to accommodate standard fire engines, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles. The city boulevards are painted with lane markings for narrow 5-foot lanes for bike-sized vehicles, but the boulevards themselves are always 4 lanes wide, plus shoulders. The bikeways have an unobstructed width of about 30 feet, and unobstructed height clearance of 14 feet. The entrance and exit ramps are single-lane, but are still wide enough for standard emergency vehicles. 

#### Innovation IS POSSIBLE for emergency response

Although traditional fire engines can use the boulevards, they may not be necessary. It may be possible for the city to have a larger number of smaller fire-fighting vehicles for different sorts of cargos:
* tender vehicles for hauling water
* pump engines for pumping from sources like canals
* rescue vehicles for hauling floodlights, hydraulic rescue tools, etc.
* hazardous materials vehicles with hazmat suits, etc.

Ideally the kinematic city buildings would all be built with standpipes and fire sprinkler systems, so pump engines and tender vehicles may be less important in a kinematic city, allowing the city to instead have more ambulances, hazmat vehicles and rescue vehicles.

## <a name="how-cities-work"></a>(4) How cities work


### <a name="rules-of-thumb"></a>(4.1) Rules of thumb

* <a name="marchetti"></a>The **Marchetti constant** says that **people tend to travel about one hour a day**. The Marchetti constant is named for Cesare Marchetti, although **it was really Yacov Zahavi** who first wrote about it.

  For people that commute to a job, the average commute is about 30 minutes each way. For people who aren't commuting, it is common to spend about an hour each day on other sorts of trips: chores, errands, appointments, etc. 

  > In the United States in 2013, commuting trips represented only 20 percent of weekday urban trips, 28 percent of vehicle kilometers traveled, and 39 percent of public transport passenger-kilometer traveled.[^bertaud]
  
  The one-hour number seems to be surprizingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. The one-hour constant is believed to have held true in:
  + Ancient Rome
  + Medieval Paris
  + Victorian London — steam train
  + New York — subway
  + Los Angles — car 

  > "Using data from cities across several countries, including the United States, England, Germany, and some developing nations, [Yacov] Zahavi discovered the surprising result that the total amount of time an average individual spends on travel each day is approximately the same regardless of the city size or the mode of transportation. ... we tend to spend about an hour each day traveling, whoever and wherever we are. ... the average commute time from home to work is about half an hour each way independent of the city or the means of transportation.
  > 
  > ... the increase in transportation speed resulting from the marvelous innovations of the past couple of hundred years has not been used to reduce commuting time but instead has been used to increase commuting distances. ... the size of cities has to some degree been determined by the efficiency of their transportation systems for delivering people to their workplaces in not much more than half an hour's time."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

* <a name="jevons"></a>The **Jevons paradox**, or Jevons effect, says that if it becomes possible to use a resource more and more efficiently, then instead of using less of the resource, people actually use more. Total consumption increases because demand increases as efficiency drives the costs down.

* <a name="induced-demand"></a>**Induced demand** says that as the supply of a resource increases, more of it will be consumed. If you add a new lane to a congested highway, it does not reduce congestion, but instead increases the total number of trips made. Induced demand might be better described as **latent demand**. The demand was actually there all along, there was just a lack of supply to meet the demand. The concept of induced demand is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity. I think this is misguided. The existance of latent demand is a sign that we should be striving to increase the supply of transportation capacity, and increase [Kinematic Range](#kinematic-range).

* <a name="feedback-loops"></a>**Feedback loops** will cause either vicious cycles and virtuous cycles in the amount of land area required for roads or other transportation networks.
  * Suburban vicious cycle
    * Suburban sprawl  ➔  longer roads  ➔  more circulation overhead
  * Urban virtuous cycle
    * Dense urban core  ➔  shorter distances  ➔  less overhead

* <a name="linear"></a>**Linear scaling** says that if a city doubles in size, many measurable characteristics of the city, such as the number of businesses, also double in size.

  > "Double the size of a city and on average you'll find twice as many businesses. The proportionality constant is 21.6, meaning that there is approximately one establishment for about every 22 people in a city, regardless of the city size. Or to put it slightly differently, on average a new workplace is created each time the population of a city increases by just 22 people. ... on average, there are only about 8 employees for every establishment, again regardless of the size of city."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

* <a name="superlinear"></a>**15% superlinear scaling** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the economy of the city tends to grow by about 115% (meaning it **more than doubles** in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" in per-capita economic output for everyone in the city.[^scale] This 15% superlinear growth seems to apply to the whole physical and social metabolism of the city, rather than just the economic aspects of the city. The 15% surplus shows up in statistics about:
  * wages
  * wealth
  * patents
  * AIDS cases
  * crime
  * restaurants
  * variety of business services available (meaning, how long the "long tail" of the city is)

  > "... it's illuminating to ask how many different types of businesses there are in a city. ... The data confirm that diversity systematically increases with poplution size. ... an extrapolation of the data strongly suggests that if we could measure diversity to the finest possible resolution it would scale logarithmically with city size."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

  |---
  | City Population | Average Hourly Wage | Superlinear Scale Factor |
  |-:|:-:|:-:
  | 40,000 | $16 | (-15%)^4 below $28
  | 80,000 | $18 | (-15%)^3 below $28
  | 160,000 | $21 | (-15%)^2 below $28
  | 320,000 | $24 | -15% below $28

  > Economic literature linking the wealth of cities to spatial concentrations is quite abundant and is no longer controversial in academic circles. ... The 2009 World Bank Development Report "Reshaping Economic Geography," and the report of the Commission on Growth and Development "Urbanization and Growth" (published the same year) exhaustively summarize and document the theoretical and empirical arguments justifying the economic advantage provided by the spatial concentration of economic activities in large cities.[^bertaud]
  > &mdash; Alain Bertaud

  > "High-tech invention is extraordinarily concentrated in just a handful of cities. ... The top 10 city-regions account for nearly 60 percent of inventors in biology, chemistry and medicine, with greater New York and the San Francisco Bay Area accounting for more than 10 percent each. Seventy percent of inventors in computer science are in the top 10 regions; the Bay Area alone has more than one-quarter of them. And the top 10 regions account for almost 80 percent of inventors in semiconductors, with one-quarter again in the Bay Area and another 15 percent in greater New York." ... "This clustering of inventors has only increased over time, growing by about five percentage points for biology, chemistry, and medicine, 15 percentage points for computer science, and about 20 percentage points for semiconductors between 1971 and 2007."[^florida]
  
  > "The study finds that when inventors move from a smaller to a large cluster, they experience increases in both the number of patents they generate and the impact of those patents, based on their subsequent citations. For example, a computer scientist who moves from the median cluster to a cluster at the 75th percentile in size would experience a 12 percent increase in productivity, while an inventor in biology and chemistry doing the same would see an 8.4 percent productivity gain. Overall, a just a 10 percent increase in the size of a cluster leads to a 0.66 percent increase in the number of patents produced by a top inventor each year."[^florida]

  > "Third, the clustering of high-tech inventors brings real benefits to the American economy as a whole. ... [Enrico Moretti] estimates that the U.S. would produce about 11 percent fewer patents each year under such a scenario. The country would see a roughly 15 percent annual decline in semiconductor patents, a 13 percent decline in computer science, and a 10 percent decline in biology and chemistry, if the geography of inventors was more equal."[^florida]


  
* <a name="sublinear"></a>**15% economies of scale** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the network of roads, electrical cables, and other supporting infrastructure of the city tends to grow by about 85% (meaning it **less than doubles** in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" economy of scale, both economically and environmentally.[^scale] 

  > "Once one starts to think about (the causes of economic growth),
  > it is hard to think about anything else."
  > &mdash; Robert Lucas, Nobel laureate in Economics 

* <a name="zoning"></a>**TODO: need a name for these notes on zoning, scale, etc.** 

  > In a paper published in 2015, the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti found that, between 1964 and 2009, the high cost of housing in some US cities relative to wages had lowered aggregate US GDP by 13.5 percent: "Most of the loss was likely caused by increased constraints to housing supply in high productivity cities like New York, San Francisco and San Jose. Lowering regulatory constraints in these cities to the level of the median city would expand their work force and increase U.S. GDP by 9.5%.[^bertaud]

  > City clusters already exist of course, like the Randstad in the Netherlands, which links Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The urban development around San Francisco Bay could also be considered a city cluster. What is different with the Chinese concept of cluster is their scale. The Randstad connects only 7 million people, while San Francisco Bay (including Silicon Valley) has only 6.2 million people. By contrast, the urban cluster of the Pearl River Delta already had 65 million people in 2010, larger than the entire population of the United Kingdom but concentrated on less than 10,000 square kilometers! The recent urban cluster including Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei links together more than 105 million people.[^bertaud]




### <a name="kinematic-range"></a>(4.3) Kinematic range

**Kinematic range** is a measure of **mobility**. It's a measure of the capactiy and efficiency of a transportation network. Good mobility is more important than it sounds. It's not just about making rush-hour traffic a little less tiresome. Good mobility actually has significant implications for:
  * job opportunities
  * affordable housing
  * economic growth & prosperity
  * social prosperity

**Kinematic range** is measured in [Floor Area](#floor-area), but it really represents the range of destinations that a person can get to. In the real world, a destination would be something like your friend's house, your dentist's office, or a library or coffee shop.

  * **factors:** kinematic range is a function of lots of different factors:
    * **_starting location_** &mdash; are you starting at the center of town, or out at the edge?
    * **_urban density_** &mdash; how many destinations are there per square mile?
    * **_mode of transport_** &mdash; are you walking, or in a car?
    * **_encumbrances_** &mdash; do you have a stroller, or a wheelchair?
    * **_age_**, **_race_**, & **_gender_** &mdash; can you safely take the subway, or do you need to take a cab?
    * **_time of day_** &mdash; are the trains even running at this hour?
    * **_traffic congestion_**
    * **_travel bans_** & **_security checkpoints_** &mdash; are you allowed into that area?

  * In **Haxby, Montana**, with a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach about a half dozen homes, with perhaps 10,000 square feet of floorspace, so that means your 30-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>30</sub>**, is about **10,000 square feet**.
  
  * In **San Francisco**, if you are able-bodied and travel by bicycle or public transit, but you do not use a car, then in 30 minutes you can probably get from almost any building in the city to almost any room in any other building in the city. But without a car, there are fairly few places you can get to outside the city limits within 30 minutes. The buildings in San Franicsco have a total of about 540 million square feet of floorspace, and your **KR<sub>30</sub>** might be about **450 million square feet**, which is about 50-thousand-fold higher than your range in Haxby.
  
  * **Wurster Hall** is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It's a fairly typical mid-rise building, with a normal mix of offices, meeting rooms (classrooms), and open plan work spaces. Most of the floorspace is in the wider base in the first three floors, but there's a narrower tower that's ten stories tall. The building has a total of about 225,000 square feet of floorspace, and within 2 minutes you can go between almost any two points in the building, so that's a 2-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>2</sub>**, of **225,000 square feet**.
  
  * On the **UC Berkeley campus**, traveling by foot, it takes about 25 minutes to walk between two buildings at opposite ends of the main campus. If it takes another 2 minutes to get from the lobby door of a building to a top-floor room, and vice-versa, that means any two rooms on the whole campus are within a 29-minute range. If the campus has about 10 million square feet of floorspace<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, then your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **10 million square feet**.  

  * In the **US Pentagon building**, it is possible to walk between any two points in less than seven minutes. The Pentagon has 6.6 million square feet of floorspace, so that's a **KR<sub>7</sub>** of **6.6 million square feet**.[^wiki_pentagon] 

### <a name="kinematic-booster-effect"></a>(4.4) Kinematic windfall

This next section is conjectural, so please evaluate it more skeptically.

[Kinematic range](#kinematic-range) almost always increases as cities get bigger. I believe that increase in kinematic range is what drives the [15% superlinear scaling](#superlinear) effect.

> Prud'homme and Lee's paper, titled "Size, Sprawl, Speed and the Efficiency of Cities," shows that productivity per worker is closely correlated to the average number of jobs per worker that are reachable in less than 60 minutes. In Korean cities, a 10 percent increase in the number of jobs accessible per worker corresponds to a 2.4 percent increase in workers' productivity.[^bertaud]

As a city grows, at first, kinematic range increases as population increases, perhaps in a roughly linear relationship. Unfortunately, as cities get too big, they start to sprawl and suffer from traffic congestion. Eventually, there's a **kinematic lag**, where the kinematic range stops its 1-to-1 tracking of population growth, and begins to lag behind.

This whole kinematic cities proposal is all about trying to reduce that kinematic lag in larger cities. The proposed kinematic city design is an attempt to keep increasing a city's kinematic range even as its population grows in the millions.

Take the **San Francisco Bay Area** as an example. The Bay Area is a conurbation that encompasses major cities like San Francisco and San Jose, as well as lots of smaller cities, like Oakland, Berkeley, and Mountain View. The entire population is about 8 million people, depending where you draw the boundaries. 

If you estimate floorspace at about 600 square feet per person, that means there's about 5 billion square feet of floorspace in the Bay Area. Your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be **5 billion square feet**, if you could magically get from any point in the area to any other point in under 30 minutes. But you can't.

As a rough estimate, let's say that from any room in any random building in the Bay Area, within 30 minutes you can reach about one quarter of the other buildings in the Bay Area. That means your actual **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **1.25 billion square feet**.

If we could just improve your travel times, we could quadruple your KR<sub>30</sub> range. If kinematic range is in fact what drives the [15% superlinear scaling](#superlinear) effect, then doubling the KR<sub>30</sub> for the Bay Area would yield a 15% windfall in average hourly wages, patents per capita, GDP, etc. Doubling KR<sub>30</sub> gets you a 15% windfall, and quadrupling gets you **a 30% windfall** (actually more like 32%, because 1.15^2 is 1.3225).

The San Francisco Bay Area GDP was about $535 billion in 2019.[^facc]  A 30% increase would be an **additional $160 billion annual GDP**.

Is it conceivable that the Bay Area could be re-engineered to quadruple travel ranges? Yes, but it would require a lot of changes: maybe a hyperloop, or a lot of Boring Company tunnels. It would be expensive, and it would take decades. For example:
  * the 2013 Bay Bridge Eastern Span, from San Francisco to Oakland, took over a decade to build and cost $7 billion
  * the 1976 BART system was a comparable amount, if measured in today's dollars
  * the 2006 Big Dig in Boston cost $21 billion

Building from scratch has its own challenges, and is also crazy expensive, but it does have the advantage that it can be done much more quickly.

## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions


### <a name="could-we-build"></a>Could we build a kinematic city?

**Yes.** The kinematic city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

### <a name="could-we-transform"></a>Could we turn London or Paris into kinematic cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

### <a name="could-ideas-trickle-down"></a>Could kinematic ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the kinematic city designs, and make their cities incrementally more kinematic, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

### <a name="do-ideas-impact-democracy"></a>Do kinematic ideas impact democracy and governance?

**No.** The kinematic city designs are politically neutral. The designs are just about transportation systems and about the physical, spatial layout of the buildings in the city.

A kinematic city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a kinematic city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a kinematic city, and they would both be kinematic cities.

### <a name="ramp-notes"></a>Ramps vs. stairs

The idea of having **no stairs** and **no elevators** sounds crazy to most people when they first hear it, because it's so different from all the normal buildings and cities that we're used to.

However, if you run the numbers, and run simulations, it turns out that getting rid of elevators and stairs works out just fine. Instead of making it harder to get places, having no elevators makes it **faster** to get between any two random locations. 

The kinematic city **ramp-only** design:
* is faster and more convenient for people in wheelchairs, and people with strollers
* is faster for everybody else too
* works better for delivery robots
* works better after a natural disaster
* takes up less space in the building
  > In the Seagram building (which has 38 floors), the area used for elevators and utility shafts occupies 31 percent of the area of a typical floor.[^bertaud]

* can be built more quickly
* is less expensive to build
* is less expensive to operate
* is less expensive to maintain
* has a smaller carbon footprint
  > "Lifts also use a large amount of energy to run. For buildings that are largely served by lifts, you can add a rough figure of 5 to 15 per cent onto building energy running costs."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf



### Population

> "More recent data, however, reveal substantial urban‐rural fertility gaps (i.e. of one child or more per woman) that tend to be wider at more advanced stages of the fertility transition" [^lerch]

> "In the full sample of countries, rural fertility is almost 20 percent higher than the urban level on average in the pre‐transitional cohorts. ... The ratio increases sharply in the first 20 transition cohorts to 40 percent, stabilizing at this level in the subsequent 10 cohorts. After 30 cohort years have elapsed since the transition onset, the average rural‐urban ratio has dropped monotonically down to 1.23 (in the 55th transition cohort)." [^lerch]

### HVAC

> "The simulations show that the cooling energy demand of the analyzed building in the Greater Accra region is 113.9 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 31% and 50% for the projected climates for 2030 and 2050, respectively. For the analyzed building in the Ashanti region, the cooling energy demand is 104.4 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 6% and 15% for the 2030 and 2050 climates, respectively."

## Hypothetical locations

Just as a thought experiment, it can be interesting to look at regions of existing cities and think about which places might be large enough to sustain a new car-free kinematic district...

**Treasure Island**

Would a site like Treasure Island (incl. Yerba Buena Island) be a good suitable test site? It’s about 2.5 sq. km, maybe 13 times smaller than Mountain View but currently only populates 2,500 (33 times less than Mountain View)?

No, too small. Also too remote -- being entirely surrounded by water is a loss in terms of commute times and ranges. Ferries are slow. Cars are subject to all the existing traffic congestion. A BART extension would cost billions, and perhaps tens of billions. Potentially that BART extension alone would be more expensive than an entire "Big Bet" seed on a 50-square mile greenfield site.

Treasure Island would certainly have huge market demand. Every apartment you built would rent for thousands of dollars a month. But just buying all the land on Treasure Island, at market prices, would cost you billions. And construction costs would be $500 per square foot, so even once you owned the island, it would still cost $400,000 per apartment to build housing. If you built office space too, and high schools, and police stations, pretty soon you've got a construction budget up over ten billion for your "small scale" starter project!

In contrast, buying 50 square miles in a satellite location on the outskirts of a city in Africa could be relatively affordable, and you might be met with a warmer welcome in the whole multi-year design review & permitting process.

**Brisbane, California**

Brisbane Baylands would be a better site than Treasure Island. The city of Brisbane, just south of San Francisco, does have a large undeveloped parcel that would be big enough to build a bit of a Kinematic City in.

Brisbane Baylands has slightly more land area than Treasure Island, and there's no new construction work already underway like Treasure Island has. Plus Caltrain and 101 run right through it, and a Muni light rail station is there. And it's immediately adjacent to San Francisco, with no bridge crossing or ferry required.

Brisbane Baylands already has a private land owner and private developer that want to build on it. It could be a great location for a kinematic district, but only if the voters in Brisbane wanted denser development, which they don't.

**Standford University**

Or the Standford University campus, at 13 square miles, more than an order of magnitude larger than Treasure Island, would be a candidate for a kinematic district. It's also in a developed
urban area, with good connectivity to highways 101 and 280, Caltrain, and two existing international airports. And, unlike Treasure Island, it's not surrounded by water, which means all the area immediately around it falls into its kinematic range.

But for Stanford to work as a location, people would have to be willing to tear down some of what's already built there. And the whole project would only be possible in some very like scenario where the city of Palo Alto were willling welcome hundreds of thousands of new neighbors, with all the strain that would bring on already congested highways, airports, and train lines.

**Other San Francisco Bay Area sites**

There are other sites all around the Bay Area that are big enough and well located, if it were possible to get approval to build densely on them. Half Moon Bay, Pescadero, or, oddly, the huge empty space right in middle of the Bay itself, north of the Dumbarton bridge and south of the 92 bridge, which in many ways would be nearly perfect, if we didn't care about wildlife reserves, which we do.

**Greenfield locations**

Instead of looking at infill locations in places like California, I think it would be easier, faster, and more fruitful to instead pitch the idea of kinematic districts to people who are already in the process of planning large new developments on open greenfield sites, the way people are doing in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

**The Sea Ranch**

Further afield, there's the Sea Ranch. More land area than the Stanford Campus, but with a population of only 1,300 people, so a small pool of people to buy out, and a small number of buildings to be removed. The weather is great, the views are great, the hiking is great. But it's remote: it's only got a tiny airport, and no port, no rail, no major highway. I think it would only really work in some science fiction scenario where you could build a hyperloop tunnel to San Francisco and Silicon Valley...

**Northern California Coast**

There are other similar sites up the California coast, like in the Eureka area, with similar pros and cons. Or the area around the Little River Airport by Mendocino, if the State of California suddenly decided to allow development in the State Park property.

## Small kinematic cities vs. small conventional cities

A small-scale purely-kinematic city would work just fine, and it would have some advantages over a similarly sized car-centric or transit-centric city. Lower transportation costs might be the largest single selling point. But I think the advantages just might not be large enough to matter to anyone. For small-scale cities, car-centric designs actually work reasonably well, as do designs based on buses and bus rapid transit.

The car & bus system only starts to break down once a city gets large enough to have serious traffic congestion problems, and it's only at that scale that the kinematic city design starts to really outshine the other options.

---
## Small kinematic districts within large existing cities

A different case is a small-scale kinematic neighborhood within a larger car-centric city. The problem with that scenario is that it may be the worst of both worlds: outside of the kinematic neighborhood you have to use a car to get around, but within the kinematic neighborhood there are no roads and no parking, so you can't use a car. So if you want to commute to a job in the kinematic neighborhood, you still need a car, and you still fight urban traffic congestion, but then you can't drive right up to your office, and instead have to park somewhere at the edge of the kinematic neighborhood and then switch to foot or small vehicle to get the last distance. That makes your commute *longer* than it would have been in a regular car-centric city.

It seems like this would only work if there were some way that external trips outside the kinematic district weren't cumbersome. We need some innovation that allows people to start and end trips within a car-free area without paying any time penalty in the trip.

Perhaps, for example, some way where you can ride your regular 40-pound e-bike right from your front door, at 15-mph, to the edge of the newly kinematically redeveloped Stanford Research Park. Then, when you reach the edge of the old traditional Palo Alto street grid, without getting off your e-bike, you ride right up a little ramp into the back of an empty "Tesla Fairing Van", which is like a full-size car, with it's own car-sized batteries, motors, and wheels, but which is designed so that you can steer it with your e-bike handlebars, without getting off your bike. Once you reach your job at the Google Mountain View campus, or at Apple Park, you ride your bike out of the Tesla Fairing Van, leave your bike at your desk, and the Tesla Fairing Van autonomously redeploys itself for someone else to use. But now we're back to a design where you have to start an R&D company and get NHTSA approvals before you buy land and break ground on new housing.

A more natural pairing would be small-scale kinematic neighborhoods centered on train stations for either subway trains, or light rail, or commuter trains like Caltrain. That's a workable design, but I don't think there's much opportunity for it in existing cities. In existing cities, the area around subway stops and train stations is already very developed, with expensive real estate, and expensive existing buildings, and lots of land reserved for streets, so that the remaining parcels are separated into islands. It would take a lot of time and money to try to rebuild a few square miles of that into a kinematic neighborhood.
