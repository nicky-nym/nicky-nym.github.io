## <a name="summary"></a>Summary


> "Studies have consistently linked city living with poorer mental health. For example, growing up in an urban environment is correlated with twice the risk of developing schizophrenia as growing up in the countryside."[^macdonald]

> "Mental health is almost uniformly worse in cities... that's just what the data shows," [Andreas] Meyer-Lindenberg says over the phone. "There isn't really a bright side to this."[^macdonald]

> "Meyer-Lindenberg is currently tracking how different parts of the city affect our mental wellbeing, using a technique called ecological momentary assessment, in which participants repeatedly report on the environment around them in real time. Various studies have suggested that nature – be that a tree or a park – has an important impact on people’s mental health."[^macdonald]

### <a name="transportation"></a>(1.1) Transportation proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no cars** within city limits
    * no private cars
    * no taxis
    * no ubers, lyfts
    * no waymos and self-driving cars
  * **no rail** within city limits
    * no subways
    * no light rail
    * no trollies or trams
  * **nothing airborne** within city limits
    * no delivery drones
    * no helicopters
    * no gondolas
  * **nothing big**
    * no buses or bus rapid transit (BRT)
    * no trucks
    * no mass transit
  * **no gas engines** in vehicles
    * no motorcycles
  * **nothing fast**
    * no motorcycles
  * **no stops** &mdash; keep traffic flowing
    * no traffic lights
    * no stop signs
    * no large intersections
    * no personal rapid transit, pods, people movers, or things with fixed stops
  * **no freeways**, and no free roads

Instead, we have
  * <a name="bikeish"></a>**bike-sized vehicles**
    * restrictions
        > below 18 mph "pedestrians are more likely to survive being hit by a car than die, while at higher speeds the reverse is true" [^levinson]
        > "Small changes in speed have big impacts on fatality rates: a person is 70 percent more likely to be killed by a car moving at 30 mph versus 25 mph." [^ng]
    * mixed-use vehicles
      * Some people may own their own bikes, wheelchairs, or other vehicles, which they can park at home or in parking spaces at their destination.
      * Some people may choose not to own their own vehicles, and instead use vehicle rental services such as Mobike, Lime, Motivate, or JUMP Bikes.
      * Some people may choose to travel in pedicabs or other small vehicles that have a human driver or are self-driving.
    * Innovation is NOT REQUIRED
      * A kinematic city could be built today using off-the-shelf bikes and other vehicles purchased from amazon.com.
    * Innovation IS POSSIBLE &mdash; a kinematic city can incorporate new products as they emerge on the market, sush as
      * new models of electric bikes, scooters, etc.
      * scooters and bicycles that can autonomously reposition themselves from where they are left to where they are needed. (Companies like Tortoise and Uber are working on autonomous scooters.[^dickey])
      * small vehicles that are fully self-driving, like self-driving wheelchairs, go-karts, or other single-person vehicles
      * wireless charging stations at public parking spaces
      * automated congestion pricing
      * battery swapping services
  * **covered laneways**
    * rain-sheltered pedestrian sidewalks
    * rain-sheltered bike-sized lanes &mdash; 5-foot wide lanes, not 10' or 12' wide car lines
  * **laneway tolls** & **parking tolls**
    * no tolls on laneways that aren't congested
    * highest tolls at rush-hour, or on busy laneways
    * tolls are per-minute, not per-mile (to prevent slow "street blimp" advertising vehicles)
    * free parking when space is ample
    * highest parking tolls in congested areas
  * common-carrier **delivery lockers**[^quirk]
    * package-delivery lockers, located along the laneways
    * shared by Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and anyone else who would like to use them

### <a name="spatial-layout"></a>(1.2) Spatial layout proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no highways**
  * **no roads** with lanes wide enough for cars and trucks
  * **no empty rooftops**
  * **no single-story buildings** such as ranch houses &mdash; (don't squander land area)
  * **no skyscrapers** and no high-rise residential buildings &mdash; (keep construction costs down)
  * **no private suburban lawns** 

Instead, we have: 
  * mid-rise buildings of about **six stories, similar to Paris**
  * **row-houses** and "walk-up" apartments
  * buildings spaced to avoid dark areas that would be far from windows and skylights &mdash; (keep lighting costs down)
  * buildings with ventilation chimneys &mdash; (keep HVAC costs down)
  * buildings with windows that open
  * a grid of **bike-sized boulevards**
    * rain-sheltered boulevards, each with four narrow bike-sized lanes, each 5 feet wide, plus shoulders
    * grade-separated intersections, so your entire commute has no stop signs or traffic lights
    * a grid of highline trails above the bike boulevards
  * city blocks of about 660 feet by 660 feet
  * about one iconic **landmark structure** per million people, inspired by examples such as:
    * the Eiffel Tower in Paris
    * St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow
    * Big Ben and the tower from the Palace of Westminster in London
    * the leaning tower of Pisa
    * the Space Needle in Seattle
    * the Tower Bridge in London
    * the Makkah Royal Clock Tower in Mecca
    * the Gateway Arch in St. Louis
    * Potola Palace in Lhasa, Tibet
    * Westminster Abbey in London
    * Le Mont-Saint Michel
    * the pyramids of Giza
    * Chateau Frontenac in Quebec


### <a name="ramp"></a>(1.3) Ramp proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no stairways**, no stairs, and no steps &mdash; (don't squander floor space)
  * **no elevators** &mdash; (at $100,000 or more each)
  * **no escalators**

The only way to go "upstairs" or "downstairs" in a kinematic city is by using
  * flights of **wheelchair ramps**
  * hallway ramps
  * sidewalk ramps
  * bike path ramps


### <a name="safety"></a>(1.4) Safety proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no gas lines**
  * **no telephone poles**
  * **no overhead power lines**

Instead, we have: 
  * **underground power lines**
  * **911 call response times averaging 3 to 4 minutes**
    > "Improvements in response time and medicine are responsible for about one-third of the reduction in fatality rates from crashes in the UK."[^levinson]

#### Innovation NOT REQUIRED for emergency response

The city boulevards are wide enough to accommodate standard fire engines, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles. The city boulevards are painted with lane markings for narrow 5-foot lanes for bike-sized vehicles, but the boulevards themselves are always 4 lanes wide, plus shoulders. The bikeways have an unobstructed width of about 30 feet, and unobstructed height clearance of 14 feet. The entrance and exit ramps are single-lane, but are still wide enough for standard emergency vehicles. 

#### Innovation IS POSSIBLE for emergency response

Although traditional fire engines can use the boulevards, they may not be necessary. It may be possible for the city to have a larger number of smaller fire-fighting vehicles for different sorts of cargos:
* tender vehicles for hauling water
* pump engines for pumping from sources like canals
* rescue vehicles for hauling floodlights, hydraulic rescue tools, etc.
* hazardous materials vehicles with hazmat suits, etc.

Ideally the kinematic city buildings would all be built with standpipes and fire sprinkler systems, so pump engines and tender vehicles may be less important in a kinematic city, allowing the city to instead have more ambulances, hazmat vehicles and rescue vehicles.

## <a name="how-cities-work"></a>(4) How cities work


### <a name="rules-of-thumb"></a>(4.1) Rules of thumb


* <a name="linear"></a>**Linear scaling** says that if a city doubles in size, many measurable characteristics of the city, such as the number of businesses, also double in size.

  > "Double the size of a city and on average you'll find twice as many businesses. The proportionality constant is 21.6, meaning that there is approximately one establishment for about every 22 people in a city, regardless of the city size. Or to put it slightly differently, on average a new workplace is created each time the population of a city increases by just 22 people. ... on average, there are only about 8 employees for every establishment, again regardless of the size of city."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West




### <a name="kinematic-range"></a>(4.3) Kinematic range


  * In **Haxby, Montana**, with a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach about a half dozen homes, with perhaps 10,000 square feet of floorspace, so that means your 30-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>30</sub>**, is about **10,000 square feet**.
  
  * In **San Francisco**, if you are able-bodied and travel by bicycle or public transit, but you do not use a car, then in 30 minutes you can probably get from almost any building in the city to almost any room in any other building in the city. But without a car, there are fairly few places you can get to outside the city limits within 30 minutes. The buildings in San Franicsco have a total of about 540 million square feet of floorspace, and your **KR<sub>30</sub>** might be about **450 million square feet**, which is about 50-thousand-fold higher than your range in Haxby.
  
  * **Wurster Hall** is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It's a fairly typical mid-rise building, with a normal mix of offices, meeting rooms (classrooms), and open plan work spaces. Most of the floorspace is in the wider base in the first three floors, but there's a narrower tower that's ten stories tall. The building has a total of about 225,000 square feet of floorspace, and within 2 minutes you can go between almost any two points in the building, so that's a 2-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>2</sub>**, of **225,000 square feet**.
  
  * On the **UC Berkeley campus**, traveling by foot, it takes about 25 minutes to walk between two buildings at opposite ends of the main campus. If it takes another 2 minutes to get from the lobby door of a building to a top-floor room, and vice-versa, that means any two rooms on the whole campus are within a 29-minute range. If the campus has about 10 million square feet of floorspace<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, then your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **10 million square feet**.  

  * In the **US Pentagon building**, it is possible to walk between any two points in less than seven minutes. The Pentagon has 6.6 million square feet of floorspace, so that's a **KR<sub>7</sub>** of **6.6 million square feet**.[^wiki_pentagon]

## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions


### <a name="could-we-build"></a>Could we build a kinematic city?

**Yes.** The kinematic city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

### <a name="could-we-transform"></a>Could we turn London or Paris into kinematic cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

### <a name="could-ideas-trickle-down"></a>Could kinematic ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the kinematic city designs, and make their cities incrementally more kinematic, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

### <a name="do-ideas-impact-democracy"></a>Do kinematic ideas impact democracy and governance?

**No.** The kinematic city designs are politically neutral. The designs are just about transportation systems and about the physical, spatial layout of the buildings in the city.

A kinematic city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a kinematic city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a kinematic city, and they would both be kinematic cities.

> "over 1.35 million [traffic] deaths and up to 50 million injuries occur every year, with 90% of these fatalities occurring in low- and middle-income countries" [^road-safety]


### Congestion

> "In a study last year, Inrix estimated that the cost of congestion in the United States alone was $305 billion (USD)" [^turbot]

> "In L.A., nothing concerns locals more than traffic—not personal safety, the cost of living, or even the housing market—according to a 2016 poll by the Los Angeles Times. Drivers there spend an average of 80 hours in gridlock every year, according to a report by Texas A&M University."[^bliss]


### <a name="spatial-layout-notes"></a>Geometry and spatial layout

> "Above six storeys, significant extra costs are incurred in sprinkler systems, and after ten storeys, the need for enhanced fire escape provision means that the extra costs can only be recouped if storey heights push up above 15 storeys."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

> "For five Melbourne office buildings of the following heights: 3, 7, 15, 42 and 52 storeys, the two high-rise buildings were found to have approximately 60 per cent more energy embodied per unit gross floor area (GFA) in their materials than the low-rise buildings."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

> "In addition, there are higher operation and maintenance costs in taller buildings..."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

### <a name="ramp-notes"></a>Ramps vs. stairs

The idea of having **no stairs** and **no elevators** sounds crazy to most people when they first hear it, because it's so different from all the normal buildings and cities that we're used to.

However, if you run the numbers, and run simulations, it turns out that getting rid of elevators and stairs works out just fine. Instead of making it harder to get places, having no elevators makes it **faster** to get between any two random locations. 

The kinematic city **ramp-only** design:
* is faster and more convenient for people in wheelchairs, and people with strollers
* is faster for everybody else too
* works better for delivery robots
* works better after a natural disaster
* takes up less space in the building
  > In the Seagram building (which has 38 floors), the area used for elevators and utility shafts occupies 31 percent of the area of a typical floor.[^bertaud]

* can be built more quickly
* is less expensive to build
* is less expensive to operate
* is less expensive to maintain
* has a smaller carbon footprint
  > "Lifts also use a large amount of energy to run. For buildings that are largely served by lifts, you can add a rough figure of 5 to 15 per cent onto building energy running costs."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf



### Population

> "More recent data, however, reveal substantial urban‐rural fertility gaps (i.e. of one child or more per woman) that tend to be wider at more advanced stages of the fertility transition" [^lerch]

> "In the full sample of countries, rural fertility is almost 20 percent higher than the urban level on average in the pre‐transitional cohorts. ... The ratio increases sharply in the first 20 transition cohorts to 40 percent, stabilizing at this level in the subsequent 10 cohorts. After 30 cohort years have elapsed since the transition onset, the average rural‐urban ratio has dropped monotonically down to 1.23 (in the 55th transition cohort)." [^lerch]

### HVAC

> "The simulations show that the cooling energy demand of the analyzed building in the Greater Accra region is 113.9 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 31% and 50% for the projected climates for 2030 and 2050, respectively. For the analyzed building in the Ashanti region, the cooling energy demand is 104.4 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 6% and 15% for the 2030 and 2050 climates, respectively." [^dodoo]

### Competitions

### Bicycles

> In 1896, Susan B. Anthony said bicycling was doing "more to emancipate women than anything else in the world." [^kamiya]

> "No technology holds as much promise as the humble bicycle—especially when we include its newfangled, electrified cousins—to solve the geometry problem that is getting people short distances around a big city." We don't need no flying cars. Just give us a place to ride, and watch e-bikes eat everything. [^alter]

> "Nearly half of American kids walked or biked to school in 1950; today that figure is 13 percent." [^grabar]

### Freight

> "urban planners historically focused on residential travel and personal behavior, failing to integrate the movement of goods into their planning." [^wenzel]

## Hypothetical locations

Just as a thought experiment, it can be interesting to look at regions of existing cities and think about which places might be large enough to sustain a new car-free kinematic district...

**Treasure Island**

Would a site like Treasure Island (incl. Yerba Buena Island) be a good suitable test site? It’s about 2.5 sq. km, maybe 13 times smaller than Mountain View but currently only populates 2,500 (33 times less than Mountain View)?

No, too small. Also too remote -- being entirely surrounded by water is a loss in terms of commute times and ranges. Ferries are slow. Cars are subject to all the existing traffic congestion. A BART extension would cost billions, and perhaps tens of billions. Potentially that BART extension alone would be more expensive than an entire "Big Bet" seed on a 50-square mile greenfield site.

Treasure Island would certainly have huge market demand. Every apartment you built would rent for thousands of dollars a month. But just buying all the land on Treasure Island, at market prices, would cost you billions. And construction costs would be $500 per square foot, so even once you owned the island, it would still cost $400,000 per apartment to build housing. If you built office space too, and high schools, and police stations, pretty soon you've got a construction budget up over ten billion for your "small scale" starter project!

In contrast, buying 50 square miles in a satellite location on the outskirts of a city in Africa could be relatively affordable, and you might be met with a warmer welcome in the whole multi-year design review & permitting process.

**Brisbane, California**

Brisbane Baylands would be a better site than Treasure Island. The city of Brisbane, just south of San Francisco, does have a large undeveloped parcel that would be big enough to build a bit of a Kinematic City in.

Brisbane Baylands has slightly more land area than Treasure Island, and there's no new construction work already underway like Treasure Island has. Plus Caltrain and 101 run right through it, and a Muni light rail station is there. And it's immediately adjacent to San Francisco, with no bridge crossing or ferry required.

Brisbane Baylands already has a private land owner and private developer that want to build on it. It could be a great location for a kinematic district, but only if the voters in Brisbane wanted denser development, which they don't.

**Standford University**

Or the Standford University campus, at 13 square miles, more than an order of magnitude larger than Treasure Island, would be a candidate for a kinematic district. It's also in a developed
urban area, with good connectivity to highways 101 and 280, Caltrain, and two existing international airports. And, unlike Treasure Island, it's not surrounded by water, which means all the area immediately around it falls into its kinematic range.

But for Stanford to work as a location, people would have to be willing to tear down some of what's already built there. And the whole project would only be possible in some very like scenario where the city of Palo Alto were willling welcome hundreds of thousands of new neighbors, with all the strain that would bring on already congested highways, airports, and train lines.

**Other San Francisco Bay Area sites**

There are other sites all around the Bay Area that are big enough and well located, if it were possible to get approval to build densely on them. Half Moon Bay, Pescadero, or, oddly, the huge empty space right in middle of the Bay itself, north of the Dumbarton bridge and south of the 92 bridge, which in many ways would be nearly perfect, if we didn't care about wildlife reserves, which we do.

**Greenfield locations**

Instead of looking at infill locations in places like California, I think it would be easier, faster, and more fruitful to instead pitch the idea of kinematic districts to people who are already in the process of planning large new developments on open greenfield sites, the way people are doing in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

**The Sea Ranch**

Further afield, there's the Sea Ranch. More land area than the Stanford Campus, but with a population of only 1,300 people, so a small pool of people to buy out, and a small number of buildings to be removed. The weather is great, the views are great, the hiking is great. But it's remote: it's only got a tiny airport, and no port, no rail, no major highway. I think it would only really work in some science fiction scenario where you could build a hyperloop tunnel to San Francisco and Silicon Valley...

**Northern California Coast**

There are other similar sites up the California coast, like in the Eureka area, with similar pros and cons. Or the area around the Little River Airport by Mendocino, if the State of California suddenly decided to allow development in the State Park property.

## Small kinematic cities vs. small conventional cities

A small-scale purely-kinematic city would work just fine, and it would have some advantages over a similarly sized car-centric or transit-centric city. Lower transportation costs might be the largest single selling point. But I think the advantages just might not be large enough to matter to anyone. For small-scale cities, car-centric designs actually work reasonably well, as do designs based on buses and bus rapid transit.

The car & bus system only starts to break down once a city gets large enough to have serious traffic congestion problems, and it's only at that scale that the kinematic city design starts to really outshine the other options.

---
## Small kinematic districts within large existing cities

A different case is a small-scale kinematic neighborhood within a larger car-centric city. The problem with that scenario is that it may be the worst of both worlds: outside of the kinematic neighborhood you have to use a car to get around, but within the kinematic neighborhood there are no roads and no parking, so you can't use a car. So if you want to commute to a job in the kinematic neighborhood, you still need a car, and you still fight urban traffic congestion, but then you can't drive right up to your office, and instead have to park somewhere at the edge of the kinematic neighborhood and then switch to foot or small vehicle to get the last distance. That makes your commute *longer* than it would have been in a regular car-centric city.

It seems like this would only work if there were some way that external trips outside the kinematic district weren't cumbersome. We need some innovation that allows people to start and end trips within a car-free area without paying any time penalty in the trip.

Perhaps, for example, some way where you can ride your regular 40-pound e-bike right from your front door, at 15-mph, to the edge of the newly kinematically redeveloped Stanford Research Park. Then, when you reach the edge of the old traditional Palo Alto street grid, without getting off your e-bike, you ride right up a little ramp into the back of an empty "Tesla Fairing Van", which is like a full-size car, with it's own car-sized batteries, motors, and wheels, but which is designed so that you can steer it with your e-bike handlebars, without getting off your bike. Once you reach your job at the Google Mountain View campus, or at Apple Park, you ride your bike out of the Tesla Fairing Van, leave your bike at your desk, and the Tesla Fairing Van autonomously redeploys itself for someone else to use. But now we're back to a design where you have to start an R&D company and get NHTSA approvals before you buy land and break ground on new housing.

A more natural pairing would be small-scale kinematic neighborhoods centered on train stations for either subway trains, or light rail, or commuter trains like Caltrain. That's a workable design, but I don't think there's much opportunity for it in existing cities. In existing cities, the area around subway stops and train stations is already very developed, with expensive real estate, and expensive existing buildings, and lots of land reserved for streets, so that the remaining parcels are separated into islands. It would take a lot of time and money to try to rebuild a few square miles of that into a kinematic neighborhood.
