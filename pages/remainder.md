### <a name="transportation"></a>(1.1) Transportation proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no cars** within city limits
    * no private cars
    * no taxis
    * no ubers, lyfts
    * no waymos and self-driving cars
  * **no rail** within city limits
    * no subways
    * no light rail
    * no trollies or trams
  * **nothing airborne** within city limits
    * no delivery drones
    * no helicopters
    * no gondolas
  * **nothing big**
    * no buses or bus rapid transit (BRT)
    * no trucks
    * no mass transit
  * **no gas engines** in vehicles
    * no motorcycles
  * **nothing fast**
    * no motorcycles
  * **no stops** &mdash; keep traffic flowing
    * no traffic lights
    * no stop signs
    * no large intersections
    * no personal rapid transit, pods, people movers, or things with fixed stops
  * **no freeways**, and no free roads

Instead, we have
  * <a name="bikeish"></a>**bike-sized vehicles**
    * restrictions
    * mixed-use vehicles
      * Some people may own their own bikes, wheelchairs, or other vehicles, which they can park at home or in parking spaces at their destination.
      * Some people may choose not to own their own vehicles, and instead use vehicle rental services such as Mobike, Lime, Motivate, or JUMP Bikes.
      * Some people may choose to travel in pedicabs or other small vehicles that have a human driver or are self-driving.
    * Innovation is NOT REQUIRED
      * A kinematic city could be built today using off-the-shelf bikes and other vehicles purchased from amazon.com.
    * Innovation IS POSSIBLE &mdash; a kinematic city can incorporate new products as they emerge on the market, sush as
      * new models of electric bikes, scooters, etc.
      * scooters and bicycles that can autonomously reposition themselves from where they are left to where they are needed. (Companies like Tortoise and Uber are working on autonomous scooters.[^dickey])
      * small vehicles that are fully self-driving, like self-driving wheelchairs, go-karts, or other single-person vehicles
      * wireless charging stations at public parking spaces
      * automated congestion pricing
      * battery swapping services
  * **covered laneways**
    * rain-sheltered pedestrian sidewalks
    * rain-sheltered bike-sized lanes &mdash; 5-foot wide lanes, not 10' or 12' wide car lines
  * **laneway tolls** & **parking tolls**
    * no tolls on laneways that aren't congested
    * highest tolls at rush-hour, or on busy laneways
    * tolls are per-minute, not per-mile (to prevent slow "street blimp" advertising vehicles)
    * free parking when space is ample
    * highest parking tolls in congested areas
  * common-carrier **delivery lockers**[^quirk]
    * package-delivery lockers, located along the laneways
    * shared by Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and anyone else who would like to use them

### <a name="spatial-layout"></a>(1.2) Spatial layout proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no highways**
  * **no roads** with lanes wide enough for cars and trucks
  * **no empty rooftops**
  * **no single-story buildings** such as ranch houses &mdash; (don't squander land area)
  * **no skyscrapers** and no high-rise residential buildings &mdash; (keep construction costs down)
  * **no private suburban lawns** 

Instead, we have: 
  * mid-rise buildings of about **six stories, similar to Paris**
  * **row-houses** and "walk-up" apartments
  * buildings spaced to avoid dark areas that would be far from windows and skylights &mdash; (keep lighting costs down)
  * buildings with ventilation chimneys &mdash; (keep HVAC costs down)
  * buildings with windows that open
  * a grid of **bike-sized boulevards**
    * rain-sheltered boulevards, each with four narrow bike-sized lanes, each 5 feet wide, plus shoulders
    * grade-separated intersections, so your entire commute has no stop signs or traffic lights
    * a grid of highline trails above the bike boulevards
  * city blocks of about 660 feet by 660 feet
  * about one iconic **landmark structure** per million people, inspired by examples such as:
    * the Eiffel Tower in Paris
    * St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow
    * Big Ben and the tower from the Palace of Westminster in London
    * the leaning tower of Pisa
    * the Space Needle in Seattle
    * the Tower Bridge in London
    * the Makkah Royal Clock Tower in Mecca
    * the Gateway Arch in St. Louis
    * Potola Palace in Lhasa, Tibet
    * Westminster Abbey in London
    * Le Mont-Saint Michel
    * the pyramids of Giza
    * Chateau Frontenac in Quebec


### <a name="ramp"></a>(1.3) Ramp proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no stairways**, no stairs, and no steps &mdash; (don't squander floor space)
  * **no elevators** &mdash; (at $100,000 or more each)
  * **no escalators**

The only way to go "upstairs" or "downstairs" in a kinematic city is by using
  * flights of **wheelchair ramps**
  * hallway ramps
  * sidewalk ramps
  * bike path ramps


### <a name="safety"></a>(1.4) Safety proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no gas lines**
  * **no telephone poles**
  * **no overhead power lines**

Instead, we have: 
  * **underground power lines**


#### Innovation NOT REQUIRED for emergency response

The city boulevards are wide enough to accommodate standard fire engines, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles. The city boulevards are painted with lane markings for narrow 5-foot lanes for bike-sized vehicles, but the boulevards themselves are always 4 lanes wide, plus shoulders. The bikeways have an unobstructed width of about 30 feet, and unobstructed height clearance of 14 feet. The entrance and exit ramps are single-lane, but are still wide enough for standard emergency vehicles. 

#### Innovation IS POSSIBLE for emergency response

Although traditional fire engines can use the boulevards, they may not be necessary. It may be possible for the city to have a larger number of smaller fire-fighting vehicles for different sorts of cargos:
* tender vehicles for hauling water
* pump engines for pumping from sources like canals
* rescue vehicles for hauling floodlights, hydraulic rescue tools, etc.
* hazardous materials vehicles with hazmat suits, etc.

Ideally the kinematic city buildings would all be built with standpipes and fire sprinkler systems, so pump engines and tender vehicles may be less important in a kinematic city, allowing the city to instead have more ambulances, hazmat vehicles and rescue vehicles.

### <a name="kinematic-range"></a>(4.3) Kinematic range


  * In **Haxby, Montana**, with a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach about a half dozen homes, with perhaps 10,000 square feet of floorspace, so that means your 30-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>30</sub>**, is about **10,000 square feet**.
  
  * In **San Francisco**, if you are able-bodied and travel by bicycle or public transit, but you do not use a car, then in 30 minutes you can probably get from almost any building in the city to almost any room in any other building in the city. But without a car, there are fairly few places you can get to outside the city limits within 30 minutes. The buildings in San Franicsco have a total of about 540 million square feet of floorspace, and your **KR<sub>30</sub>** might be about **450 million square feet**, which is about 50-thousand-fold higher than your range in Haxby.
  
  * **Wurster Hall** is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It's a fairly typical mid-rise building, with a normal mix of offices, meeting rooms (classrooms), and open plan work spaces. Most of the floorspace is in the wider base in the first three floors, but there's a narrower tower that's ten stories tall. The building has a total of about 225,000 square feet of floorspace, and within 2 minutes you can go between almost any two points in the building, so that's a 2-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>2</sub>**, of **225,000 square feet**.
  
  * On the **UC Berkeley campus**, traveling by foot, it takes about 25 minutes to walk between two buildings at opposite ends of the main campus. If it takes another 2 minutes to get from the lobby door of a building to a top-floor room, and vice-versa, that means any two rooms on the whole campus are within a 29-minute range. If the campus has about 10 million square feet of floorspace<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, then your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **10 million square feet**.  

  * In the **US Pentagon building**, it is possible to walk between any two points in less than seven minutes. The Pentagon has 6.6 million square feet of floorspace, so that's a **KR<sub>7</sub>** of **6.6 million square feet**.[^wiki_pentagon]

## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions


### <a name="could-we-build"></a>Could we build a kinematic city?

**Yes.** The kinematic city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

### <a name="could-we-transform"></a>Could we turn London or Paris into kinematic cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

### <a name="could-ideas-trickle-down"></a>Could kinematic ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the kinematic city designs, and make their cities incrementally more kinematic, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

### <a name="do-ideas-impact-democracy"></a>Do kinematic ideas impact democracy and governance?

**No.** The kinematic city designs are politically neutral. The designs are just about transportation systems and about the physical, spatial layout of the buildings in the city.

A kinematic city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a kinematic city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a kinematic city, and they would both be kinematic cities.

## <a name="notes"></a>(5) Notes

### <a name="traffic-safety"></a>Traffic safety

> "over 1.35 million [traffic] deaths and up to 50 million injuries occur every year, with 90% of these fatalities occurring in low- and middle-income countries" [^road-safety]


### Congestion

> "In a study last year, Inrix estimated that the cost of congestion in the United States alone was $305 billion (USD)" [^turbot]

> "In L.A., nothing concerns locals more than traffic—not personal safety, the cost of living, or even the housing market—according to a 2016 poll by the Los Angeles Times. Drivers there spend an average of 80 hours in gridlock every year, according to a report by Texas A&M University."[^bliss]


### <a name="spatial-layout-notes"></a>Geometry and spatial layout

> "Above six storeys, significant extra costs are incurred in sprinkler systems, and after ten storeys, the need for enhanced fire escape provision means that the extra costs can only be recouped if storey heights push up above 15 storeys."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

> "For five Melbourne office buildings of the following heights: 3, 7, 15, 42 and 52 storeys, the two high-rise buildings were found to have approximately 60 per cent more energy embodied per unit gross floor area (GFA) in their materials than the low-rise buildings."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

|---
| Height<br>in stories | GJ per square meter<br>gross floor area[^roaf] |
|-:|-:|
|  3 | 10.7
|  7 | 11.9
| 15 | 16.1
| 42 | 18.0
| 52 | 18.4
|---

> "In addition, there are higher operation and maintenance costs in taller buildings..."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

### <a name="ramp-notes"></a>Ramps vs. stairs

The idea of having **no stairs** and **no elevators** sounds crazy to most people when they first hear it, because it's so different from all the normal buildings and cities that we're used to.

However, if you run the numbers, and run simulations, it turns out that getting rid of elevators and stairs works out just fine. Instead of making it harder to get places, having no elevators makes it **faster** to get between any two random locations. 

The kinematic city **ramp-only** design:
* is faster and more convenient for people in wheelchairs, and people with strollers
* is faster for everybody else too
* works better for delivery robots
* works better after a natural disaster
* takes up less space in the building
  > In the Seagram building (which has 38 floors), the area used for elevators and utility shafts occupies 31 percent of the area of a typical floor.[^bertaud]

* can be built more quickly
* is less expensive to build
* is less expensive to operate
* is less expensive to maintain
* has a smaller carbon footprint
  > "Lifts also use a large amount of energy to run. For buildings that are largely served by lifts, you can add a rough figure of 5 to 15 per cent onto building energy running costs."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf



### Population

> "More recent data, however, reveal substantial urban‐rural fertility gaps (i.e. of one child or more per woman) that tend to be wider at more advanced stages of the fertility transition" [^lerch]

> "In the full sample of countries, rural fertility is almost 20 percent higher than the urban level on average in the pre‐transitional cohorts. ... The ratio increases sharply in the first 20 transition cohorts to 40 percent, stabilizing at this level in the subsequent 10 cohorts. After 30 cohort years have elapsed since the transition onset, the average rural‐urban ratio has dropped monotonically down to 1.23 (in the 55th transition cohort)." [^lerch]

### HVAC

> "The simulations show that the cooling energy demand of the analyzed building in the Greater Accra region is 113.9 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 31% and 50% for the projected climates for 2030 and 2050, respectively. For the analyzed building in the Ashanti region, the cooling energy demand is 104.4 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 6% and 15% for the 2030 and 2050 climates, respectively." [^dodoo]

### Competitions

_Urban Environment Design_ (UED) Magazine's _Hebei International Urban Planning and Design Competition – Xingdong New Area Urban Design International Master Competition_ [^stouhi]


### Freight

> "urban planners historically focused on residential travel and personal behavior, failing to integrate the movement of goods into their planning." [^wenzel]
