### <a name="kinematic-range"></a>Kinematic range


  * In **Haxby, Montana**, with a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach about a half dozen homes, with perhaps 10,000 square feet of floorspace, so that means your 30-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>30</sub>**, is about **10,000 square feet**.
  
  * In **San Francisco**, if you are able-bodied and travel by bicycle or public transit, but you do not use a car, then in 30 minutes you can probably get from almost any building in the city to almost any room in any other building in the city. But without a car, there are fairly few places you can get to outside the city limits within 30 minutes. The buildings in San Franicsco have a total of about 540 million square feet of floorspace, and your **KR<sub>30</sub>** might be about **450 million square feet**, which is about 50-thousand-fold higher than your range in Haxby.
  
  * **Wurster Hall** is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It's a fairly typical mid-rise building, with a normal mix of offices, meeting rooms (classrooms), and open plan work spaces. Most of the floorspace is in the wider base in the first three floors, but there's a narrower tower that's ten stories tall. The building has a total of about 225,000 square feet of floorspace, and within 2 minutes you can go between almost any two points in the building, so that's a 2-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>2</sub>**, of **225,000 square feet**.
  
  * On the **UC Berkeley campus**, traveling by foot, it takes about 25 minutes to walk between two buildings at opposite ends of the main campus. If it takes another 2 minutes to get from the lobby door of a building to a top-floor room, and vice-versa, that means any two rooms on the whole campus are within a 29-minute range. If the campus has about 10 million square feet of floorspace<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, then your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **10 million square feet**.  

  * In the **US Pentagon building**, it is possible to walk between any two points in less than seven minutes. The Pentagon has 6.6 million square feet of floorspace, so that's a **KR<sub>7</sub>** of **6.6 million square feet**.[^wiki_pentagon]

## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions


### <a name="could-we-build"></a>Could we build a kinematic city?

**Yes.** The kinematic city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

### <a name="could-we-transform"></a>Could we turn London or Paris into kinematic cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

### <a name="could-ideas-trickle-down"></a>Could kinematic ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the kinematic city designs, and make their cities incrementally more kinematic, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

### <a name="do-ideas-impact-democracy"></a>Do kinematic ideas impact democracy and governance?

**No.** The kinematic city designs are politically neutral. The designs are just about transportation systems and about the physical, spatial layout of the buildings in the city.

A kinematic city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a kinematic city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a kinematic city, and they would both be kinematic cities.

## <a name="notes"></a>(5) Notes

### <a name="traffic-safety"></a>Traffic safety

> "over 1.35 million [traffic] deaths and up to 50 million injuries occur every year, with 90% of these fatalities occurring in low- and middle-income countries" [^road-safety]


### Congestion

> "In a study last year, Inrix estimated that the cost of congestion in the United States alone was $305 billion (USD)" [^turbot]

> "In L.A., nothing concerns locals more than traffic—not personal safety, the cost of living, or even the housing market—according to a 2016 poll by the Los Angeles Times. Drivers there spend an average of 80 hours in gridlock every year, according to a report by Texas A&M University."[^bliss]


### <a name="spatial-layout-notes"></a>Geometry and spatial layout

> "Above six storeys, significant extra costs are incurred in sprinkler systems, and after ten storeys, the need for enhanced fire escape provision means that the extra costs can only be recouped if storey heights push up above 15 storeys."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

> "For five Melbourne office buildings of the following heights: 3, 7, 15, 42 and 52 storeys, the two high-rise buildings were found to have approximately 60 per cent more energy embodied per unit gross floor area (GFA) in their materials than the low-rise buildings."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

|---
| Height<br>in stories | GJ per square meter<br>gross floor area[^roaf] |
|-:|-:|
|  3 | 10.7
|  7 | 11.9
| 15 | 16.1
| 42 | 18.0
| 52 | 18.4
|---

> "In addition, there are higher operation and maintenance costs in taller buildings..."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf

### <a name="ramp-notes"></a>Ramps vs. stairs

The idea of having **no stairs** and **no elevators** sounds crazy to most people when they first hear it, because it's so different from all the normal buildings and cities that we're used to.

However, if you run the numbers, and run simulations, it turns out that getting rid of elevators and stairs works out just fine. Instead of making it harder to get places, having no elevators makes it **faster** to get between any two random locations. 

The kinematic city **ramp-only** design:
* is faster and more convenient for people in wheelchairs, and people with strollers
* is faster for everybody else too
* works better for delivery robots
* works better after a natural disaster
* takes up less space in the building
  > In the Seagram building (which has 38 floors), the area used for elevators and utility shafts occupies 31 percent of the area of a typical floor.[^bertaud]

* can be built more quickly
* is less expensive to build
* is less expensive to operate
* is less expensive to maintain
* has a smaller carbon footprint
  > "Lifts also use a large amount of energy to run. For buildings that are largely served by lifts, you can add a rough figure of 5 to 15 per cent onto building energy running costs."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf



### Population

> "More recent data, however, reveal substantial urban‐rural fertility gaps (i.e. of one child or more per woman) that tend to be wider at more advanced stages of the fertility transition" [^lerch]

> "In the full sample of countries, rural fertility is almost 20 percent higher than the urban level on average in the pre‐transitional cohorts. ... The ratio increases sharply in the first 20 transition cohorts to 40 percent, stabilizing at this level in the subsequent 10 cohorts. After 30 cohort years have elapsed since the transition onset, the average rural‐urban ratio has dropped monotonically down to 1.23 (in the 55th transition cohort)." [^lerch]

### HVAC

> "The simulations show that the cooling energy demand of the analyzed building in the Greater Accra region is 113.9 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 31% and 50% for the projected climates for 2030 and 2050, respectively. For the analyzed building in the Ashanti region, the cooling energy demand is 104.4 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 6% and 15% for the 2030 and 2050 climates, respectively." [^dodoo]

### Competitions

_Urban Environment Design_ (UED) Magazine's _Hebei International Urban Planning and Design Competition – Xingdong New Area Urban Design International Master Competition_ [^stouhi]


### Freight

> "urban planners historically focused on residential travel and personal behavior, failing to integrate the movement of goods into their planning." [^wenzel]
