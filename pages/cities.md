# <a name="0"></a>Impossible cities

This paper outlines a summer 2020 design proposal for building car-free cities.

1. **Streets designed for mobility &mdash; better design choices** 
  * This proposal hinges on a re-design of what a city street looks like, to try to get less congestion, twice the average speed, and twice the total throughput (compared to, say, Manhattan New York). See <a href="#1">chapter 1</a>.
2. **Mobility for prosperity, not for speed**
  * The main goal of the new design is to increase urban mobility. However, non-intuitively, the benefit is **not** faster commutes, but is instead higher wages & more social opportunities, as well as higher land values & better investment return rates. See <a href="#2">chapter 2</a>.
3. **Beyond mobility &mdash; better cities & better outcomes**
  * The main goal is better mobility, but the design has a variety of other potential upsides. Cities like this should be greener, cleaner, fairer, safer, simpler, and more reliable & resilient. See <a href="#3">chapter 3</a>.
4. **This matters now**
  * This is an important area for study & discussion right now, because there's about to be a huge influx of urban population, and a huge increase in urban construction. The construction of buildings will happen no matter what, so it would be good to try to do it in conjunction with the construction of modern transporation networks, rather than just repeating what was done in past decades. See <a href="#4">chapter 4</a>.
5. **This requires better funding models & better value capture agreements**
  * Construction is **_very_** expensive. In order to fund the huge amount of construction required for new transportation networks, we need to get much better at **land value capture**. We need to set up reliable "fiscal engines" that can robustly recover the value created on each development project and reinvest it quickly on the next project. See <a href="#5">chapter 5</a>.

## <span class="chapter">_Chapter 1_ &mdash; Streets designed for mobility</span>

The Impossible City proposal hinges on a basic redesign of what a city street could look like. 

The Impossible design
  * replaces cars & buses with **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles
  * replaces stop signs and traffic lights with **grade-separated** intersections
  * replaces outdoor, ground-level streets with **elevated, sheltered streets**

The result is:
  * less congestion and **twice the throughput**
  * **50% annual cost savings** over conventional public transit and private car ownership
  * **lower carbon emissions**, quieter streets, and less air pollution
  * **more trees**
  * a bit more available floorspace

### <a name="bike-sized"></a>Bike-sized vehicles

The <a href="#1">Impossible street design</a> replaces cars & buses with a wide variety of different kinds of **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles. For this design "bike-sized" means:

  |---
  |  | limits for most vehicles | limits for licensed cargo vehicles
  |-:|:-|:-
  | **narrow** | 30 inch width limit | 48 inch width
  | **lightweight** | 111 pounds or less | 222 pounds
  | **underpowered** | 2 horsepower or lower | 4 horsepower 
  | **slow** | 18 mph speed limit city-wide<br>with automated enforcement | 15 mph

## <span class="chapter">_Chapter 2_ &mdash; Mobility for prosperity, not for speed</span>

The [impossible streets](#1) & intersections are designed to yield **faster travel times** and **higher throughput**, compared to conventional streets in cities like San Franisco or New York.

### Beyond a faster commute

You might think that faster travel times would lead to faster commute times, but, surprisingly, that's usually not the case. Instead, when faster travel is possible, most people choose to use it to travel **further per day**, instead of using it to travel for **less time per day**. (See [Rules of thumb: Marchetti](#marchetti).)

In practice, the result of faster travel times is not shorter commute times for everyone, but is instead an increase in daily **kinematic range** for everyone.

### <a name="kinematic_range"></a>Kinematic range

  * **Kinematic range** is a measure of urban mobility. It's the number of destinations you can get to in 30 minutes or less _(or some other set amount of time)_.
  * Different cities have different kinematic ranges
    * In **Haxby, Montana**, there's not any traffic congestion, but there also aren't many places to go. With a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach a total of about **a half dozen homes**, with perhaps **10 thousand square feet of floorspace**.
    * In **San Francsico**, there are lots of places to go, but there's a lot of congestion. In 30 minutes you can reach hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and stores, with perhaps **500 million square feet of floorspace**.  San Francisco has a kinematic range that's about 50 thousand times larger than Haxby, Montana.

```
TODO: add a diagram showing different ranges?
```

<!--
### Congestion vs. kinematic range

  * A **congested** city is one where it's hard to get where you want to go, because there's too much traffic.
  * A **sleepy** little town is one where there's no traffic, but there's almost nothing in town to go to.
  * A **kinematic** city is one that has lots of destinations **_and_** they're all easy to get to.
-->

### <a name="why-does-it-matter"></a>Why does kinematic range matter?

Good mobility is more important than it sounds. It's not just about making rush-hour traffic a little less tiresome. Beyond just convenience, better mobility and kinematic range bring serious changes to the entire metabolism of a city, and to the amount of **opportunity** and **prosperity** available to people.

**For people**, having more destinations within reach means:
  * more **job offers** that are close enough to commute to
  * more **friends** & **family** who are actually close enough to drop by
  * more **schools** to choose from, and more **special classes**
  * more **doctors** to choose from, and a wider variety of **specialists** available
  * a wider variety of **churches** and **religious communities**
  * a wider variety of **events**, **meetups**, and **clubs**, and more people who share your interests
  * a wider variety of **[long tail](#glossary:long-tail)** destinations

**For shops**, **employers**, and **industry**, it means:
  * more **job candidates** to choose from
  * more **vendors** and **parts suppliers** to choose from
  * more **contractors** in different **specialized fields**
  * more **"[industrial agglomeration](#glossary:industrial-agglomeration)"**, which leads to **"[agglomeration economies](#glossary:agglomeration-economies)"** (somewhat similar to the separate idea of "economies of scale")

**For 911 calls** & first responders, it means:
  * **faster response times** and **better incident outcomes**


### <a name="windfall"></a>Kinematic windfall

Around the world, larger cities, with their larger kinematic ranges, tend to have higher wages than smaller cities.

As city size increases, when the number of people (and destinations) in the city grows by 100% (meaning a doubling in size), then the economy of the city tends to grow by about 115% (meaning it more than doubles in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" in per-capita economic output for everyone in the city.[^scale]

This 15% superlinear growth seems to apply to the whole physical and social metabolism of the city, rather than just the economic aspects of the city. The 15% surplus shows up in statistics about:
  * **wages**
  * **wealth**
  * **patents**
  * **AIDS cases**
  * **crime**
  * **restaurants**
  * **diversity of business services** available (meaning, how long the "[long tail](#glossary:long-tail)" of the city is)

### <a name="existing-cities"></a>The kinematics of existing cities

Larger cities have more total destinations than smaller cities, but some destinatations may be too far away for some people to get too. Denser cities have more destinattions that are within a shorter distance, but in a congested city, even nearby destinations may take a long time to get to. In practice, different cities have very different kinematics.

Singapore and Dallas-Fort Worth have very different transportation networks, with very different kinematic ranges.

  |---
  | Singapore |  | Dallas-Fort Worth
  |:-:|:-:|:-:
  | roughly 6 million | **population** | roughly 6 million
  | 20,000<br>per square mile | **density** | 600<br>per square mile
  | public transit | **main mode of<br>transportation** | cars
  | 60 minutes | **time it takes<br>for two people<br>on opposite ends<br>to meet in the middle**[^velotopia] | 30 minutes 


### <a name="improvements"></a>Improving existing cities

Existing cities, all over the world, have serious traffic congestion problems, despite spending billions on transit projects and on widening roads, in efforts to incrementally improve mobility and kinematic range. As cities grow and economies grow, the congestion problems just get worse.

Cities can improve kinematic range by **moving more people** or **moving people faster**
  * **public transit projects**
    * the **2nd Avenue Subway** project in New York
    * the **Transbay Transit Center** in San Francisco
  * **more highways**, or **more lanes**
    * the **Big Dig** in Boston
  * **more throughput per lane**
    * the **HOV Carpool Lanes** in Los Angeles
    * the **congestion pricing** in London

Cities can also improve kinematic range by **becoming denser**, so that more people and more destinations are nearby
  * **transit oriented development**
  * **dense urban cores**
  * **infill development**
  * **multi-use zoning**

Someday, in the future, cities might also be able to improve kinematic range by using **newly invented transit options**
  * **hyperloop** transit tubes
  * **Boring company tunnels**
  * **flying cars**

### <a name="transit_vs_cars"></a>Transit vs. cars

Here in the United States, in discussions about urban planning and transporation, many people fall into one of two opposing camps:

  * **pro-transit people**, who want to see
    * fewer cars on the road
    * less space set aside for parking
    * more bike lanes and bus lanes
    * more funding for some combination of subways, light rail, buses, bus rapid transit, and other public transit
  * **pro-status-quo "car" people**, who 
    * do not want to lose automobile lanes in return for bike lanes and bus lanes
    * do now want to pay the huge costs of creating and operating public transit systems
    * do not want to take slow, inconvenient, public transit options when they could just drive

In addition to the **pro-transit** camp and the **pro-status-quo** camp, there's also a third camp, of people who are optimistic about new technologies for **automated, on-demand transporation**, like self-driving cars and delivery drones. 

**Proponents** of shared, self-driving cars point to advantages like the greatly reduced need for parking compared to conventional cars, yet the convenience of direct door-to-door routes.

**Opponents** of self-driving cars point to inherently low throughput-per-lane numbers for cars vs. buses and trains, and the real-world congestion problems that we're already seeing from on-demand car-share services like Lyft and Uber.


### <a name="impossible"></a>The "Impossible city" design proposal

Given what we know about the cost and throughput of cars, buses, and rail, and given what we know about the emerging new alternatives, what's the best we could possibly do?

If we could plan a whole urban transporation network from scratch, what's the optimal mix of different transit modes? Which options are the most affordable, and which ones maximize personal mobility, speedy deliveries, and kinematic range?

What follows is a design proposal for what I believe is a **simple**, **cheap**, **reliable**, **low-risk** transportation network that has **high throughput**, good **transit speed**, nearly **door-to-door** convenience, and takes up less space than roads, leaving more **land area** for parks and buildings.

The **Impossible city** is just one simple design for a more Kinematic city. I'm not suggesting that this is the best design; rather, I'm putting it out as a *straw-man* proposal, in hopes that it might be a step in the right direction, and that it might spark conversation that leads to better ideas.

The Impossible design calls for:

  * bikes & **bike-sized vehicles** only, instead of cars, trucks, buses, or trains
  * **electric vehicles** only, instead of gas engines
  * **grade-separated intersections** only, instead of traffic lights, stop signs, or roundabouts
  * **sheltered roads**, sheltered from wind and rain
  * **underground wiring**, instead of telephone poles and overhead power lines

### <a name="look_like"></a>What would it look like?

**A grid**
  * The Impossible design has a **grid of city blocks**, similar to the layout of cities like Manhattan New York. That's in contrast to older cities like Rome and Paris, which have more intricate street layouts, and in contrast to many 20th century suburban developments or new cities like Dubai, which often have more circular or curvy streets, or layouts that are intentionally asymmetrical, with cul-de-sacs and loops.
 
**A big grid**
  * Instead of the rectangular blocks that Manhattan has, the Impossible design has square blocks. Big blocks: more **like big Salt Lake City blocks** than little Portland, Oregon blocks.
  
**With normal buildings**
  * The buildings in each city block would just be normal buildings. They could be mid-rise or high-rise, in any sort of architectural style.

**But with sheltered streets**
  * The "streets" would look very different from normal city streets:
    * They would **not be outdoors**, but would instead be long breeze-way corridors inside a four-story building.
    * They would **not be at ground level**, but instead would be up on the second or third floor.
    * They would **not have intersections**, but instead would be "grade-separated", so that the east-west streets pass above the north-south streets.


### <a name="why"></a>Why is this a better design?

The Impossible design is built entirely around **bicycles**, **bike-sized electric vehicles**, and **sheltered streets** with **no interestions**. At first blush, it's hard to imagine that this is a practical design. It doesn't seem like an entire city could have no buses, trains, or cars, and still manage to move millions of people a day with reduced travel times and increased travel ranges.

It **seems** impossible, because cars **seem** like fast, long-range vehicles, and buses and trains **seem** like high-capacity transit. 

Cars **truly are** fast when they're on highways, but in cities cars are hugely inefficient and ineffective, requiring huge amounts of lane space per car, and traveling with high burst speeds but poor average speeds.

Buses and trains **truly are** high-capacity and high-throughput when everyone on them is going from point A to point B. If you have a group of 50 people who are all gathered together (e.g., at a hotel) and who all need to go to the exact same place (e.g., an office or work site) at the same time, then a bus is a wonderfully efficient and effective choice. But in a city, if people are starting from a variety of different places (different apartment buildings on different blocks), and going to a variety of different places (schools, stores, offices), then buses turn out to have quite poor average throughput.

### <a name="affordable"></a>Affordable

There's no point in designing a new urban development that is too expensive to build, and no point in building a new urban development that is too expensive for people to afford to move to.

* **Affordable to build**
  - The impossible street design use conventional construction techniques and avoids the most expensive transportation options: 
    * no buses (at $500,000 each, or $8,000+ per passenger seat)
    * no subway cars (at $10,000+ per passenger seat)
    * no subway tunnels (at $100,000,000+ per mile)
    * no automobiles (at $20,000+ each)
    * no multi-story parking garage structures (at $20,000 per parking space)[^carl_walker]
    * no sprawling suburban road network
  - The design lends itself to mid-rise density neighborhoods. Mid-rise housing, for example in buildings with "4-over-1" podium construction, is less expensive to than skyscrapers, and less expensive than even ten-story buildings with concrete service cores. Mid-rise housing is also less expensive than detached single family housing. The impossible street design also offers an optional extra feature that could replace ordinary sidewalks with inclined ramps, which would offer additional cost savings by conserving usable floorspace square-footage (vs. circulation overhead) while entirely obviating the need for elevators, escalators, and stairs. 
  - For new developments built on greenfield sites, land should cost less than what it would cost in an established city. For new developments that are large, the development may gain economies of scale, in land acquisition, regulatory approval for planning and permitting, financing, and construction costs & timelines.

* **Affordable to operate**
  - The design avoids all the costs of running public transit systems (bus driver salaries, rail car maintenance, etc.) and avoids the costs of private car ownership (insurance, car payments, fuel, new tires, etc.).

* **Affordable to live in**
  - Ideally, the lower costs to build and operate the city will mean that it is more affordable to live in &mdash; with lower government transportation subsidies, there is an opportunity to have lower taxes & lower vehicle registration fees. With lower housing construction costs, housing doesn't need to be as expensive. With more units of housing within kinematic range of any given workplace, there's more market competition for buyers and renters, and an opportunity for a more efficient housing market, so that developers and landlords can't easily artificially inflate prices. Hopefully this will result in market-rate housing that is naturally affordable, without the government having to impose rent control or subsidize affordable housing.  Hopefully this might lead to less homelessness, which in turn could lead to lower government spending.
  



### <a name="convenient"></a>Convivial & convenient

Significantly increased mobility & kinematic range means that it's easier to go see people and easier to get to more places. A more mobile city is a city with more social opportunities and social prosperity.

* **Convivial**
  - easy to go see your friends & family
  - easy to do an errand for your mom
  - easy to go to weird new clubs and meetup groups to see who's there
  - easy for kids to go to parks & playgrounds on their own, without needing a ride

* **Convenient** &mdash; easy access to:
  - school & work
  - groceries & restaurants
  - gyms & laundromats
  - dentists & doctors
  - libraries & museums
  - [long tail](#glossary:long-tail) destinations &mdash; including _That One Unusual Thing_ that most people wouldn't care about, but that you really want to go to:
    * a monthly Renaissance Faire meetup
    * a weekly Burning Man art car workshop
    * a maker space with an Atomic Force Microscope
    * etc.

### <a name="durable"></a>Durable, reliable & resilient

By striving for simplicity, these new designs avoid using lots of "fragile" technologies, like elevators and traffic lights. 

* **Durable** & **reliable** 
  - The impossible design is a more reliable design, because it has fewer parts that can break, and fewer parts that need power sources. It has a transportation system that can be run by human power alone, if necessary. That's one of the advantages of getting rid of all the traffic lights, buses, subway cars, automobiles, taxis, elevators, escalators, delivery drones, etc.

  > "even when a [New York City subway] station has an elevator, workers have struggled to keep them working properly. Only about 94 percent of elevators were available in August, according to the transit agency. The rate is worse for escalators -- 87 percent were working." [^fitzsimmons]


* **Resilient** 
  - The new design is intended to be much more resilient after a natural disaster like an earthquake, hurricane, or flood. It should be possible to evacuate a building quickly in an emergency, even when the power is out. It should be possible to evacuate a city quickly without running into problems with downed power lines and traffic lights that have gone dark.




### <a name="economicly-prosperous"></a>Economicly prosperous

A city should provide for a good life for the people who live in it and work in it. 

* **Prosperous**
  - When I say "prosperous", I don't mean Wall Street bankers with vacation homes in the Hamptons. I mean prosperity in the sense of kids who get to go to good schools, teachers who have the books they need, parks with playgrounds and basketball courts, libraries with books & wifi, parents with jobs and health insurance, and jobs with safety standards and protective equipment. These are things that are common in places like rich European countries, and that can become more and more common everywhere in the world. 

* **Green growth**
  - Global poverty is a serious problem, and economic growth is a force for good, so long as the economic growth is "green growth" and so long as GDP growth goes up while carbon footprint goes down, habitat restoration use goes up, and Gini coefficients go down.

* **Kinematic windfall**
  - The impossible city design is intended to create cities that **thrive economically** compared to similarly-sized typical cities. The impossible design strives to maximize mobility and kinematic range, with the goal of harvesting a 15% windfall in wages, wealth, patents, land value, etc. See [chapter 2](#2).

> Prud'homme and Lee's paper, titled "Size, Sprawl, Speed and the Efficiency of Cities," shows that productivity per worker is closely correlated to the average number of jobs per worker that are reachable in less than 60 minutes. In Korean cities, a 10 percent increase in the number of jobs accessible per worker corresponds to a 2.4 percent increase in workers' productivity.[^bertaud]



### <a name="freedom"></a>Free, fair & friendly

A city design should not inadvertantly restrict people's freedoms or obstruct fair access. The impossible design offers more:

* **Freedom**
  - freedom of movement for everyone in the community 
  - free-range kids &mdash; who can meet up to play at the park without needing a ride, and who can walk to school without learning how to look both ways before crossing a street
  - freedom to travel without being asked for a license & registration

* **Fairness**
  - a **level playing field** for urban mobility
  - equal access to safe passage for everyone through all public space
  - full mobility for women[^gadepalli], with no "pink tax"[^mccasland] & no "trip-range" tax[^gonzalez]

* **Friendliness**
  - more **kid-friendly** streets
  - more **elder-friendly** streets
  - more **disability-friendly** space, with safer streets for people with limited vision or limited hearing, and better accessibility for people in wheelchairs

* **Accessibility**
  - stroller-friendly buildings and stroller-friendly transportation
  - wheelchair accessible routes to every part of every building
  - predictable navigation for people with limited vision
  - frequent pathside seating for elderly people


### <a name="greener"></a>Greener & cleaner

Compared to a conventional city, the impossible design should provide:

* **Lower carbon footprint** per capita
  - lower-energy commutes in smaller, more efficient vehicles
  - more efficient heating and cooling of buildings

* **More trees**
  - more trees nearby at any one time, and more trees encountered per day

* **Better air quality**
  - no diesel engines, no gas engines, less motor oil, less tire wear
  - more parks and trees

* **Less noise**
  * see [noise](#noise)


### <a name="healthier"></a>Healthier & safer

An impossible city should be **safer** and more fun to live in.

* **Healthier**
  - more opportunity to exercise while commuting
  - better air quality & less noise
  - less stressful, with less traffic congestion and more parks & tress

* **Safer**
  - no traffic accident deaths
  - faster 911 response time
  - freedom from harassment on buses & subways

<div class="hr"><a name="4"></a></div>

## <span class="chapter">_Chapter 4_ &mdash; Why this matters now</span>

These questions, about how to design better cities, are especially important right now, at this moment in history, for a few reasons.

* **[The urban population boom](#population-boom)**
  - Urban population is about to increase by 60%, with **2.5 billion more people** incoming by 2050.
* **[The urban construction boom](#construction-boom)** 
  - There is a projected **doubling of total built space** by 2050.
* **[The rise of "megacity" urban agglomerations](#megacities)**
  - By 2050, we will have 175 cities with populations between 4 million and 40 million.
* **[The onset of kinematic lag](#kinematic-lag)**
  - Large cities are increasingly suffering from congestion and kinematic lag.
* **[The mounting lost opportunities](#lost-opportunities)**
  - Kinematic lag is already a problem that artificially depresses global GDP by trillions of dollars per year, slowing the rise from poverty of billions of people.
* **[The rising current opportunities](#current-opportunities)**
  - If we could start doing better city design now, in the next few decades **we could prevent additional losses** from kinematic lag on the order of **$5 trillion dollars per year**, as well as seeing a windfall of **$15 trillion** in residential real estate value. Unfortunately, in practice, that will be impossible.

There's no way to cheaply or practically re-build existing cities, or move people _en masse_ from existing cities to new cities, but, when new cities, new suburbs, and new satellite developments are being planned and built from scratch, it would be slightly crazy to fail to try designing them as "kinematic cities". Building from scratch has its own challenges, and is also crazy expensive, but it does have the advantage that it can be done much more quickly. 

The impossible design does not depend on a particular climate, or on particular building materials. It's an anywhere-in-the world city, not just a European city, an African city, or an Arctic city. It could be built on the outskirts of an existing city, or it could be built in a brand new "greenfield" site.

> "If you build a new city you don't have to relocate or work 
> around existing roads or rivers or factories or houses. 
> You also don’t have to work around existing political processes, 
> community groups, civic organisations ... or even existing 
> regulations and rules."[^growth]
> &mdash; John Macomber, senior lecturer, Harvard Business School.



### <a name="population-boom"></a>Urban population boom

In the next 30 years, **by 2050**, we expect urban population to grow by 60%, with another **2.5 billion more people** living in cities.[^growth]

  |---
  | Year | Urban<br>portion<br>of world | Total urban population[^un-desa] |
  |-:|:-:|:-
  | 1950 |     | 0.75 billion
  | 2018 | 55% | 4.2 billion
  | 2050 | 68% | 6.7 billion
  |---

Perhaps existing cities will absorb nearly all of the 2.5 billion additional people who will live in cities by 2050, but in doing so some of their suburbs will essentially develop into big satellite cities of their own right, so the Impossible city ideas are relevant for how new developments in those satellite cities are designed. If 4% of the people did move to entirely new urban developments, that would be 100 million people in new urban developments. 

### <a name="construction-boom"></a>Urban construction boom

Existing cities are **too few and too small**, by a factor of two, for everyone who will live in them by 2050. To handle the influx, cities will build another **2.5 trillion square feet** of new buildings. These numbers can be hard to believe at first. For different projects by different authors, see the [notes about urban growth](#growth) below.


### <a name="megacities"></a>"Megacity" urban agglomerations

Currently, the world has about 33 "megacities", where a megacity is defined as an urban agglomerations with more than 10 million inhabitants. The world is projected to have 43 megacities by 2030, and about **50 megacities by 2050**, with an additional 125 large-but-not-mega cities in that land in the range between 4 million and 10 million inhabitants.[^ontariotech]


### <a name="kinematic-lag"></a>Kinematic lag

[Kinematic range](#kinematic-range) generally increases as cities get bigger. I believe that increase in kinematic range is what drives the [15% superlinear scaling](#superlinear) effect.

As a city grows, at first, kinematic range increases as population increases, perhaps in a roughly linear relationship. Unfortunately, as cities get too big, they start to sprawl and suffer from traffic congestion. Eventually, there's a **kinematic lag**, where the kinematic range stops its 1-to-1 tracking of population growth, and begins to lag behind.

This whole impossible cities proposal is all about trying to reduce that kinematic lag in larger cities. The proposed impossible city design is an attempt to keep increasing a city's kinematic range even as its population grows in the multi-millions. 

As the world adds more and more large cities and megacities, kinematic lag becomes a bigger and bigger problem, kinematic range becomes more important, and design ideas like the impossible city design become more important.

> "Contrary to common perception, megacities have not been driving global
> growth for the past 15 years. In fact, many have not grown faster than their host

> middleweights ... contributing half of global growth to 2025, gaining share from 
> today's megacities. Worldwide, we will see 13 middleweight cities become 
> megacities by 2025."[^mgi]


### <a name="lost-opportunities"></a>Lost opportunities

Take the **San Francisco Bay Area** as an example. The Bay Area is a conurbation that encompasses major cities like San Francisco and San Jose, as well as lots of smaller cities, like Oakland, Berkeley, and Mountain View. The entire population is about 8 million people, depending where you draw the boundaries. 

If you estimate floorspace at about 600 square feet per person, that means there's about 5 billion square feet of floorspace in the Bay Area. Your [**KR<sub>30</sub>**](#glossary:KR30) would be **5 billion square feet**, if you could magically get from any point in the area to any other point in under 30 minutes. But you can't.

As a rough estimate, let's say that from any room in any random building in the Bay Area, within 30 minutes you can reach about one quarter of the other buildings in the Bay Area. That means your actual **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **1.25 billion square feet**.

If we could just improve your travel times, we could quadruple your KR<sub>30</sub> range. If kinematic range is in fact what drives the [15% superlinear scaling](#superlinear) effect, then doubling the KR<sub>30</sub> for the Bay Area would yield a 15% windfall in average hourly wages, patents per capita, GDP, etc. Doubling KR<sub>30</sub> gets you a 15% windfall, and quadrupling gets you **a 30% windfall** (actually more like 32%, because 1.15<sup>^2</sup> is 1.3225).

**GDP.** The San Francisco Bay Area GDP was about $535 billion in 2019.[^facc]  A 30% annual increase would be an **additional $160 billion annual GDP**.

**Real estate.** The San Francisco Bay Area has about $1.3 trillion of residential real estate. A 30% increase in value would be a $400 billion increase, just for the residential portion of the real estate. Commercial real estate would be roughly another $400 billion. There would also be additional floor space in the roadway buildings, which might amount to another $200 billion, for a total of about $1 trillion of additional real estate value.

**Hope?** Is it conceivable that the Bay Area could be re-engineered to quadruple travel ranges? Yes, but it would require a lot of changes: maybe a hyperloop, or a lot of Boring Company tunnels. It would be expensive, and it would take decades. The Bay Area has already calcified, and for all practical purposes, big changes now are a pipe dreams. For context, here are a few examples of the giant cost of modest mobility improvements:
  * the 2013 Bay Bridge Eastern Span, from San Francisco to Oakland, took over a decade to build and cost $7 billion
  * the 1976 BART system was a comparable amount, if measured in today's dollars
  * the 2006 Big Dig in Boston cost $21 billion


### <a name="current-opportunities"></a>Current opportunities, GNP

As of 2017, the worldwide gross national product (GNP) was about $80 trillion per year. Some of that GNP comes from rural activities, like farming, and other remote activities, like mining and fishing. But the majority of GNP, more than 80%, comes from urban areas, for a total of about $65 trillion per year.[^mgi]

By 2050, global GNP will probably roughly double, to about $160 trillion per year. By 2050, more than $140 trillion of that total is likely come from the urban areas. 

Some of those "urban areas" are actually small towns with just a few thousand people, but increasingly, the majority of the urban population will be living in larger and larger cities, and those large cities also generate a disproportionately high amount of the total GNP. By 2050, about 16% of the world's population, 1.6 billion of the world's 9.8 billion people, will be living in the world's 175 largest cities, with 4 million to 40 million people each.[^ontariotech] A conservative estimate suggests those 175 cities will contribute $30 or $40 trillion per year to worldwide GNP.

Because of their size, all of those 175 cities will probably suffer from kinematic lag. If we could intervene, and by 2050 we could somehow double the kinematic range in each of those cities, we could expect to yield a 15% kinematic windfall on the GNP from those cities. That would be an ongoing windfall of maybe **$4 trillion to $6 trillion per year** in increased GNP.

### <a name="current-opportunities"></a>Current opportunities, land value

In the San Francisco Bay Area, the total residential and commercial real estate is worth about $2.6 trillion. 

The total value of all real estate, worldwide, was about $280 trillion at the end of 2017. Of that total, most is residential real estate, at $220 trillion, with just $33 trillion of commercial real estate and $27 trillion of agricultural real estate. Worldwide, residential real estate is worth more than all of the equaties & debt securities combined. [^savills]

Historically, real estate value has increased at roughly the same pace as GNP. By 2050, total worldwide real estate might be worth about $560 trillion.

By 2050, the world's 175 largest cities will have residential real estate worth more than $100 trillion. If we could double the kinematic range in those cities, we could expect to yield a 15% kinematic windfall, for maybe a **$15 trillion** increase in residential real estate value.

Unfortunately, trying to double the kinematic range of even a single city is probably impossible.

## <span class="chapter">_Chapter 5_ &mdash; Why this is impossible</span>

We know that:
* The world is rapidly building more cities & bigger cities. (See <a href="#4">chapter 4</a>)
* For new urban areas, we could design new 21st century transportation networks that would work far better for poeple than the default 20th century designs. (See chapters <a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a> & <a href="#3">3</a>)

Unfortunately, actually building cities this way is probably impossible, because of:
* <a href="#location">Location problems</a>
* <a href="#network-effect">Network effect problems</a>
* <a href="#cost">Cost problems</a>
* <a href="#land-value-capture">Land value capture & fiscal framework problems</a>
* <a href="#bootstrapping">Bootstrapping problems</a>



### <a name="location"></a>Location problems

These new urban development designs could be built in a few different types of locations, but they all have problems:

* **Infill in existing cities** and/or rebuilding portions of cities
  - Retrofitting infrastructure in existing city can be several times more expensive than building new infrastructure in new sites.[^haas]
  - Land is much more expensive to aquire in existing cities than in remote areas.
  - Opportunities for buying large parcels of land are rare.
  - There are no easy ways to integrate the new impossible neighborhood's transportation network into the city's existing transportation network(s). (See [network effect problems](#network-effect) below.)
  - Neighbors frequently oppose developments that increase density.
  - Zoning restrictions typically restrict changes in land use and density.
    - Tor example, 75% of residential land in Los Angeles is restricted to single-family homes, and 94% of land in San Jose[^buhayar]
* **New suburbs** and/or satellite cities around existing cities
  - Land anywhere **near** large cities is expensive
  - Large parcels are rare.
  - Connections between the new suburb's impossible-style transportation network and the city's existing transportation network(s) will require people to transfer between vehicles mid-trip, and will decrease mobility and kinematic range. (See [network effect problems](#network-effect) below.)
* **Greenfield cities** and/or "new city" developments
  - Before starting construction, the new city project will need to pre-purchase (or otherwise reserve), all of the adjacent land that the city may someday need to grow into. Starting with anything less than 100 square miles of land may mean the new development is restricted from ever growing to bcome a "megacity" urban agglomeration, in which case it will fail to realize its kinematic windfall potential.
  - Starting from scratch, a new greenfield city will start off with almost no population initially. Even if there were immediate and uninterrupted exponential population growth from then on, it will still take decades for the new city to become a "megacity", by which time the window of opportunity has already passed.
  - Good greenfield sites are hard to find. A good site should have:
    - enough land
    - proximity to existing cities that are thriving
    - proximity to ports and airports

### <a name="network-effect"></a>Network effect problems

Depending where construction happens, the impossible cities design faces one of two different network effect problems.

* **Population growth network effects** &mdash; for new greenfield city sites
  * People move to cities because of the opportunties there, or because they know people there. The bigger the city, the more draw it has. Once a major city has become established, and has a critical mass, it's not difficult to find people who want to move there. But if a new town is founded, with a small population, in a remote place, then it probably doesn't have enough critical mass to draw people to come live there. It's a chicken-and-egg problem: in order to attract a lot of people, a city has to be big, but before it can become big, it has to have attracted a lot of people.

* **Transporation system network effects** &mdash; for infill and suburb/satellite sites
  * Different transportation systems tend not to be complementary. 
  * Dallas-Fort Worth is a car-based city. Cars work fairly well there, allowing millions of people to reach each other in under 30 minutes. Dallas-Fort Worth does also have a light rail system, DART, but it has less than 100,000 daily riders, because it only has 4 lines, with 64 stations, which means it doesn't effectively connect any two points in the city. The network of car-based streets **does** connect any two points in the city. Free parking is available at more than half of the DART stations, but if you already have a car, and you're already in your car, it may be faster and more convenient to just drive to your final destination, rather than drive to the DART station, park, wait for a train, pay a fare, ride the train, and then walk from from the station to your destination.
  * New York City, by contrast, has a subway system with 5 million daily riders, using 36 lines with 470 stations. In New York, the subway system works well because it has achieved critical mass, effectively connecting most points in the city. Cars also work in New York, but street congestion makes cars slow, and parking is problem. In general, the car network & the subway network tend to be alternatives to each other, rather than being a unified system. The subway stations generally don't have parking lots or taxi stands, and a trip will take longer if it involves both a car leg and a subway leg.
  * An impossible city design could be used to build a single new neighborhood in, or near, an existing car-centric city, either in an infill site or as a new suburb or satellite city. The impossible bikeways would work well for trips **within** the new neighborhood, but for any trips back and forth **between** the new neighborhood and the rest of the city, trips would take longer, because people would have to have both a car leg and a bikeway leg, with the need for parking and a transfer in between. In this situation, in terms of mobility and kinematic range, people would actually have been better off if the new neighborhood had been built to match the transportation system of the rest of the city, rather than introducing a new design.


### <a name="cost"></a>Cost problems

Constructing even small buildings is expensive. Constructing entire neighborhoods or cities requires not just building housing and office space, but also building all the transportation infrastruction for roads, street lights, traffic lights, bus shelters, subway stops, and more. Plus all of the utility infrastructure, including sewers, water supply, power lines, telephone lines, and the rest.

```
TODO:

  * spending is somewhere between the high hundreds of billions of dollars, and the low trillions of dollars
  * real estate development projects now operate at a scale where it is possible to complete a coordinated, monolithic, **privately financed $10 billion construction project**

### <a name="bootstrapping"></a>Bootstrapping problems

```
TODO: The chicken-and-egg problem.
```

Building a kinematic city would take a long time and lot of resources. A minimum viable start would need:

  + a city charter (the legal documents)
  + an independent city government
  + one or more corporate real estate development partners
  + tens of square miles of fairly empty land
    - it needs to be fairly empty, yet not remote
    - it needs to be clear of conservation restrictions and legal show-stoppers
  + one or more existing local construction companies
  + whole-hearted support from existing county & state governments
  + whole-hearted support among the neighbors
  + a big anchor employer (like Amazon, or the Indonesian Government)
  + a population of people willing to move into the new housing as it is completed
  + a population of companies willing to move into new office space as it is completed
  + an existing airport, port, and interstate highway not too far away
  + start-up capital:
    - billions of dollars (in Africa)
    - or tens of billions (in the US)
    - existing construction firms & hundreds of experienced construction teams
    - reliable supplies for millions of pounds of steel, concrete, and pre-fab parts
  + a few years of time, for initial construction work, to build:
    - enough housing and office space for tens of thousand of people
    - covered laneways for vehicle circulation
    - a power grid
    - water supply
    - a sanitation system
    - other minimum basic infrastructure

## <a name="rules-of-thumb"></a><span class="chapter">Rules of thumb</span>

  * <a name="marchetti"></a>**People tend to travel about one hour a day.**
    * For people who commute, the average commute is about 30 minutes each way.
    * For people who aren’t commuting, it is common to spend about an hour each day on other sorts of trips: chores, errands, appointments, etc.
    * This "one hour per day" number has been found to be surprisingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. This is called the **Marchetti constant** (named for Cesare Marchetti, although it was really Yacov Zahavi who first wrote about it).

  * **As supply increases, consumption goes up.**
    * The <a name="jevons"></a>**Jevons paradox**, or Jevons effect, says that if it becomes possible to use a resource more and more efficiently, then instead of using less of the resource, people actually use more. Total consumption increases because demand increases as efficiency drives the costs down.
    * <a name="induced-demand"></a>**Induced demand** says that as the supply of a resource increases, more of it will be consumed. If you add a new lane to a congested highway, it does not result in reduced congestion and faster trips, but instead results in an increase in the total number of trips made. Induced demand might be better described as **latent demand**. The demand was actually there all along, there was just a lack of supply to meet the demand. The concept of induced demand is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity. I think this is misguided. The existance of latent demand is a sign that we should be striving to increase the supply of transportation capacity, and increase [Kinematic Range](#kinematic-range).[^wiki_induced_demand]


  * **Some aspects of a city scale linearly.**
    * If a city doubles in population size, many measurable characteristics of the city, such as the number of businesses, also double in size. Around the world, from small towns to big cities, regardless of the size of city, there's always about one business establishment per 22 people, and an average of about 8 employees for each establishment.

  * **Some aspects of a city scale sub-linearly.**
    * There are often economies of scale in the infrastructure of big cities (or at least, economies of density). 
    * If a city doubles in population size, meaning it grows by 100%, parts of the supporting infrastructure tend to only grow by 85%. This is tends to be true for networks of roads, electrical cables, and municipal sewers and water pipes.

  * **Some aspects of a city scale super-linearly.**
    * <a name="superlinear"></a>**15% superlinear scaling** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the economy of the city tends to grow by about 115% (meaning it **more than doubles** in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" in per-capita economic output for everyone in the city.[^scale] This 15% superlinear growth seems to apply to the whole physical and social metabolism of the city, rather than just the economic aspects of the city. The 15% surplus shows up in statistics about:
      * wages
      * wealth
      * patents
      * AIDS cases
      * crime
      * restaurants
      * variety of business services available (meaning, how long the "long tail" of the city is)

  > "... it's illuminating to ask how many different types of businesses there are in a city. ... The data confirm that diversity systematically increases with poplution size. ... an extrapolation of the data strongly suggests that if we could measure diversity to the finest possible resolution it would scale logarithmically with city size."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

  > Economic literature linking the wealth of cities to spatial concentrations is quite abundant and is no longer controversial in academic circles. ... The 2009 World Bank Development Report "Reshaping Economic Geography," and the report of the Commission on Growth and Development "Urbanization and Growth" (published the same year) exhaustively summarize and document the theoretical and empirical arguments justifying the economic advantage provided by the spatial concentration of economic activities in large cities.[^bertaud]

  > "High-tech invention is extraordinarily concentrated in just a handful of cities. ... The top 10 city-regions account for nearly 60 percent of inventors in biology, chemistry and medicine, with greater New York and the San Francisco Bay Area accounting for more than 10 percent each. Seventy percent of inventors in computer science are in the top 10 regions; the Bay Area alone has more than one-quarter of them. And the top 10 regions account for almost 80 percent of inventors in semiconductors, with one-quarter again in the Bay Area and another 15 percent in greater New York." ... "This clustering of inventors has only increased over time, growing by about five percentage points for biology, chemistry, and medicine, 15 percentage points for computer science, and about 20 percentage points for semiconductors between 1971 and 2007."[^florida]

  > "The study finds that when inventors move from a smaller to a large cluster, they experience increases in both the number of patents they generate and the impact of those patents, based on their subsequent citations. For example, a computer scientist who moves from the median cluster to a cluster at the 75th percentile in size would experience a 12 percent increase in productivity, while an inventor in biology and chemistry doing the same would see an 8.4 percent productivity gain. Overall, a just a 10 percent increase in the size of a cluster leads to a 0.66 percent increase in the number of patents produced by a top inventor each year."[^florida]

  > "Third, the clustering of high-tech inventors brings real benefits to the American economy as a whole. ... [Enrico Moretti] estimates that the U.S. would produce about 11 percent fewer patents each year under such a scenario. The country would see a roughly 15 percent annual decline in semiconductor patents, a 13 percent decline in computer science, and a 10 percent decline in biology and chemistry, if the geography of inventors was more equal."[^florida]


  
* <a name="sublinear"></a>**15% economies of scale** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the network of roads, electrical cables, and other supporting infrastructure of the city tends to grow by about 85% (meaning it **less than doubles** in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" economy of scale, both economically and environmentally.[^scale]

  > In a paper published in 2015, the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti found that, between 1964 and 2009, the high cost of housing in some US cities relative to wages had lowered aggregate US GDP by 13.5 percent: "Most of the loss was likely caused by increased constraints to housing supply in high productivity cities like New York, San Francisco and San Jose. Lowering regulatory constraints in these cities to the level of the median city would expand their work force and increase U.S. GDP by 9.5%.[^bertaud]

  > City clusters already exist of course, like the Randstad in the Netherlands, which links Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The urban development around San Francisco Bay could also be considered a city cluster. What is different with the Chinese concept of cluster is their scale. The Randstad connects only 7 million people, while San Francisco Bay (including Silicon Valley) has only 6.2 million people. By contrast, the urban cluster of the Pearl River Delta already had 65 million people in 2010, larger than the entire population of the United Kingdom but concentrated on less than 10,000 square kilometers! The recent urban cluster including Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei links together more than 105 million people.[^bertaud]

"We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"[^growth] &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

"The amount of floorspace in buildings around the world—currently about **2.5 trillion square feet**—is set to **double by 2060**" &mdash; Brian Bienkowski [^bienkowski]

It is estimated that **by 2050**:
* about **2.5 billion additional people** will live in cities (vs. 2019), with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* **68% of the world's population** will be living in cities (vs. 55% in 2018)[^growth][^mason]
* about **200 million climate migrants** will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants]
* **400 million people in India** will migrate to cities[^sharma]
* the **African population will double** from 1.3 billion today to over **2.5 billion** [^forbes]

> "The infrastructure here is really tapped," Zuckerberg said Thursday. "Housing prices are way up. Traffic is bad." He added that while Facebook is trying to do what it can to help with what he called the region’s policy challenges, "at this point we’re primarily growing outside of the Bay Area." ... The CEO said he prefers big hubs where Facebook engineering teams could be around one another, and that he doesn’t want to have a lot of small offices around the world, except for where sales teams need to be in the markets they’re serving.[^sumagaysay]

> "58 of the 89 biggest — with headquarters of 100,000 square feet and above — tech and life science companies based in the Bay Area have leased 30.4 million square feet of office space in other U.S. cities since January 2010"[^sumagaysay]



### <a name="refugees"></a>Refugee migration

"An estimated 2.4 billion people–40% of the world’s population–live in a coastal region and will likely be impacted by rising sea levels as a result of climate change."[^fast-company]

As of 2018, **70 million people** were currently displaced by war, persecution and conflict. Of the total, 51 million were Internally Displaced People (IDPs), and 26 million were refugees (including **13 million refugee children**). Most refugees live in towns and cities, not rural areas or refugee camps. Nearly 4 in every 5 refugees are in displacement situations that have lasted for at least five years.[^displaced]

### <a name="cost"></a>Greenfield development vs. retrofitting

> "when planned, built, and governed well, cities can be massive agents of positive change," ... "They can be catalysts for inclusion and powerhouses of equitable economic growth. They can help us protect the environment and limit climate change. That is why we need a new vision for urbanization." &mdash; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon [^totaro]

> "Our biggest urban problems today—growing inequality, rampant gentrification, housing unaffordability, and increasing segregation—all have roots in the staggering cost of urban land."[^manhattan]

> "Three-quarters of the residential land in Los Angeles is restricted to single-family homes, according to UrbanFootprint, software that helps government and businesses understand cities and urban markets. In San Jose, the figure is 94%." [^buhayar]

Projects in existing cities can be staggeringly expensive.
  * **$4.5 billion** for the San Francisco **Transbay Transit Center & Salesforce Tower** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$17 billion** for the **2nd Avenue Subway** project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

### Large private-sector projects

In the past, the truly large-scale new developments have all been done by governments, at least up to now. But until recently that was true for space exploration too. Times are changing.

The global banking and investment system is taking on larger private projects now, computers and the internet enable cheaper and faster R&D, recruiting, project management, etc. Global GDP gets bigger every year, and the world takes on new and bigger projects, both public and private.

Perhaps in the coming decades we'll see increasingly large private-sector real-estate developments. Or, in the public sector, perhaps we'll see some central planning efforts that are looking for big, cost-effective, high-impact solutions to giant housing shortages.

In recent decades we have begun to see the private sector take on very large scale projects, without government funding.

City Center, in Las Vegas, Nevada, is a good example
  * 17 million square feet of mixed use space
  * built in 4 years (2006 to 2010)
  * 100% privately financed, at a cost of **$11 billion** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Banks, real estate developers, and the construction industry are now operating at a level where they can coordinate the successful delivery of very large projects.

In the 2020s and 2030s, is will not be crazy to propose a $20 billion privately funded construction project. The project just needs to pencil out well, be low risk, and meet the needs of customers.

### Public-sector funding mechanisms

There are established public-sector mechanisms for funding development projects, such as Tax Increment Financing (TIF).

> "Portland, Oregon, currently dedicates about 40 percent of its TIF revenues to affordable housing. Over nine years, the program generated nearly **a quarter of a billion dollars for affordable housing**..."[^schneider]

> "The $6 billion Lincoln Yards development in Chicago ... stands to receive **$1.3 billion in TIF funding**"[^schneider]










#### <a name="size"></a>Size & density

  * **Bigger may not be better.** Big cities, with more people, have more destinations to go to, and have a wider variety of destinatations. But, if there's too much congestion, it may take too long to get to the other side of town, so that limits your kinematic range. Your range doesn't cover the whole city, just the region of the city that's within 30 minutes of you.
  * **Denser may not be better.** New York is much denser than Los Angeles, so there are more destinations per square mile in New York than there are in Los Angeles. But it takes longer to travel 10 miles in New York than in does in Los Angeles, so Los Angeles actually has a larger kinematic range than New York.
