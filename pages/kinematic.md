# Kinematic Cities

<span style="font-size:24pt;">a 2019 recipe for designing <span style="color:#DF4911;">kinematic</span><sup style="font-size:12pt;"><a href="#kinematic">?</a></sup> cities</span>

---

## Summary

 1. The world **[needs new cities](#need)**.
 1. There is **[money available](#money)** for new cities.
 1. People are **[rapidly building new cities](#precident)**.
 1. Cities can be a **[cost-effective](#cost-effective)** way to pull people out of poverty, bring economic growth, and meet basic needs.
 1. We could make new **[cities that work far better](#work-better)** for everyone, by making significantly better design choices.

### The proposal

Build new cities from scratch that are specifically designed to maximize "kinematic range".

### The problems

Existing cities:
  1. have too much traffic congestion
  2. have housing costs that are too high
  3. have transportation costs that are too high
  4. are unsafe
  5. are not resiliant after natural disasters and power failures
  6. overly limit the mobility of kids, elders, and people with disabilities
  7. are staggeringly expensive to make significant changes to (for things like replacing transportation networks)
  8. take huge amounts of time to make significant changes to

### The solution

The problems above could be greatly ameliorated by just making a handful of different design choices in a new city project:
  * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
  * **[layout choices](#layout)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
  * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

### The market

The current market size for new city construction is large:
  * in the next 30 years, another 2.5 billion people will live cities
  * 120 new cities are currently being built
  * spending is somewhere between the high hundreds of billions of dollars, and the low trillions of dollars
  * privately financed real estate developments projects are now being completed at the scale of over $10 billion for a single construction project
  * "We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth" &mdash; Paul Romer

### <a name="what-is"></a>What is a kinematic city?

No one has yet built a kinematic city. "Kinematic city" is a new made-up name for a specific set of ideas about ways to design cities. A kinematic city design strives to maximize the "kinematic range" of everybody in the city, meaning the number of destinations that are in the daily range of travel for everybody.

 1. Kinematic cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's **[mobility](#mobility)**, travel range, and opportunity, within the city.
 1. Improved urban mobility leads to significant economic improvements &mdash; in wages, GDP, patent application productivity per capita, etc.
 1. The improved mobility and travel range in the kinematic design results from unconventional design choicesL
    * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
    * **[layout choices](#layout)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

### <a name="could-we-build"></a>Could we build a kinematic city?

**Yes.** The kinematic city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

### <a name="why-build"></a>Why build kinematic cities?

If you're starting from scratch, then with a few good design choices it should be possible to build a city that **works far better** than normal conventional cities

* a kinematic city: 
   1. should have **less traffic** congestion
   1. should have **more commute destinations**
   1. should **[thrive economically](#economics)** compared to similarly-sized normal cities
   1. should have **better air quality**
   1. should be **more affordable** to build than conventional cities
   1. should have **lower operating costs**
   1. should have **lower housing costs**, and potentially **no homelessness**
   1. should be **safer** and more fun to live in
   1. should have **better accessibility**
   1. should be more **kid-friendly**
   1. should be more **elder-friendly**
   1. should have a **smaller carbon footprint** per capita
   1. should be **more resiliant** after a natural disaster or other emergency
   1. could be established as **charter cities**[^mason]

### <a name="what-would-it-take"></a>What would it take to build a kinematic city?

Rome wasn't built in a day. Building a kinematic city would take a long time and lot of resources:
  * miles of empty land, clear of conservation restrictions and legal show-stoppers 
  * local government support, and local popular support among the neighbors
  * billions of dollars of start-up capital
  * millions of pounds of steel and concrete, and hundreds of construction teams 
  * a population of people willing to move into the new housing as it is completed
  * a population of companies willing to move into new office space as it is completed

### <a name="could-we-transform"></a>Could we turn London or Paris into kinematic cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

### <a name="could-ideas-trickle-down"></a>Could kinematic ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the kinematic city designs, and make their cities incrementally more kinematic, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

### <a name="do-ideas-impact-democracy"></a>Do kinematic ideas impact democracy and governance?

**No.** The kinematic city designs are politically neutral. The designs are just about transportation systems and about the physical, spatial layout of the buildings in the city.

A kinematic city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a kinematic city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a kinematic city, and they would both be kinematic cities.

## <a name="need"></a>(1) The world needs new cities

It is estimated that **by 2050**:
* **68% of the world's population** will be living in cities (vs. 55% in 2018)[^growth][^mason]
* about **2.5 billion additional people** will live in cities (vs. 2019), with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* about **200 million climate migrants** will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants]
* **400 million people in India** will migrate to cities[^sharma]
* the **African population will double** from 1.3 billion today to over **2.5 billion** [^forbes]
* there will be at least **nine African "megacities" of 10 million people or more** (and more than two dozen African cities of 5 million or more, about the size of metropolitan Washington), but currently 60 percent of Africa’s city dwellers live in slums [^bloomberg]
* one-third of all of the French Polynesian islands would be submerged[^fast-company]

"An estimated 2.4 billion people–40% of the world’s population–live in a coastal region and will likely be impacted by rising sea levels as a result of climate change."[^fast-company]

Half of the urban area that will be needed by 2050 hasn't been built yet.[^growth]

> "we're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"
>
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

As of 2018, **70 million people** were currently displaced by war, persecution and conflict. Of the total, 51 million were Internally Displaced People (IDPs), and 26 million were refugees (including **13 million refugee children**). Most refugees live in towns and cities, not rural areas or refugee camps. Nearly 4 in every 5 refugees are in displacement situations that have lasted for at least five years.[^displaced]

> "We are at the beginning of the next wave of urbanization — a period of 
> rapid growth in both area and population... The next wave of urbanization 
> will also be defined by its sheer size — a tripling of land cover in the 
> first half of this century alone. While the carrying capacity of existing 
> cities is under increasing strain, unsustainable urban growth threatens to

> attempt to relieve the strain on our currently overloaded urban systems. It 
> promises to build energy efficiency, sustainability, and resilience in to the core of a place."[^caspar]
>
> &mdash; Caspar Herzberg, Schneider Electric


## <a name="money"></a>(2) There is money available for new cities

> "The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. 
> Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of **$100bn** (£78bn), 
> while the country’s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. 
> Malaysia's Forest City had its price initially pegged at **$100bn**, 
> while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking **$161bn**. Adding up the costs of 
> more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment 
> that can be measured in the **trillions of dollars**."[^growth]
> 
> &mdash; Wade Shepard, author and columnist

In 2019, U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for **$40 billion** in subsidies, grants, and loans for people in coastal communities who want to either move inland or elevate their homes.[^yang]

### (2.1) Large private sector projects

In recent decades we have begun to see the private sector take on very large scale projects, without government funding.

City Center, in Las Vegas Nevada, is a good example
  * 17 million square feet of mixed use space
  * built in 4 years (2006 to 2010)
  * 100% privately financed, at a cost of **$11 billion** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Banks, real estate developers, and the construction industry are now operating at a level where they can coordinate the successful delivery of very large projects.

In the 2020s and 2030s, is will not be crazy to propose a $20 billion privately funded construction project. The project just needs to pencil out well, be low risk, and meet the needs of customers.


## <a name="precident"></a>(3) People are rapidly building new cities

More than **120 new cities** are currently being built in 40 nations around the world.[^growth]

Examples:
  * Nkwashi, in Zambia, being built by Thebe Investment Management, is expected to house up to 100,000 people.[^mason]
  * Tatu City, in Kenya, being built by Rendeavour, is planned for 150,000 residents.[^mason]
  * Forest City, in Malaysia (700,000 residents) 
  * Enyimba Economic City, in Nigeria (1.5 million residents)

11,000 new buildings are built every day &mdash; **4 million new buildings a year** [^metabuild]


## <a name="cost-effective"></a>(4) Building new cities is cost-effective

Projects in existing cities can be staggeringly expensive.
  * $4.5 billion for the San Francisco Transbay Transit Center & Salesforce Tower <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $17 billion for the 2nd Avenue Subway project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $20 billion for the Hudson Yards project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $21 billion for the Big Dig in Boston <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $23 billion for the Riyadh Metro <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $32 billion to rebuild the World Trade Center in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Building on a new empty, greenfield site is a lot less expensive than building in an existing city. 
  * [TODO: examples]

New cities provide more space at lower cost per capita.
  * [TODO: examples]

New cities create value, and demand.
  * [TODO: examples]

"Our biggest urban problems today—growing inequality, rampant gentrification, housing unaffordability, and increasing segregation—all have roots in the staggering cost of urban land."[^manhattan]

"The developable land in Manhattan—excluding parks, roads, and highways—was worth between $1.54 and $1.95 trillion, for an average of $1.74 trillion"[^manhattan]

from 1950 to 2015, the value of Manhattan land grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent beyond inflation[^manhattan]

"Corner lots are significantly more valuable than mid-block lots, according to the study, and lots in close proximity to Broadway, which runs the length of the island, also have higher values."[^manhattan]

"At 305 square miles, New York City makes up only 0.008% of the total land area of the U.S., yet its $1.5tr of housing value is about 5% of the Nation-wide total. Only four states are worth more than New York City, one of which is New York State."[^metrocosm]

"Manhattan‘s housing alone is worth about $733bn, which would make it the 14th most valuable state in the country. Manhattan measures only about 20 square miles, 7.5% of New York City."[^metrocosm]

"What I found most striking of all was the value of some Manhattan neighborhoods. The Upper East Side, which occupies less than one square mile, has an astounding $96bn of housing value. That places it above Staten Island and the Bronx as well as above six states: New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and Alaska."[^metrocosm]

> In Africa "we should be building 40 million new homes or 160 Atlantas every year. ... 
> Africa has 54 countries. Altogether they do not build 1 million homes a year. 
> The gap is the opportunity. 40 million modest homes require an investment of 
> more than $1 trillion every year. The multiplier effects would add $10 trillion 
> to annual GDP. That is 5 times current GDP. Closing Africa’s housing gap can 
> generate 5 times current GDP!"
> 
> &mdash; Paul Musembwa, CEO of Warp Developments

## <a name="work-better"></a>(5) We can make cities that work far better

> "If we stick to business as usual most of it is going to be 
> disorderly and less functional than the stuff we already have."[^growth]
> 
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

> "If you build a new city you don't have to relocate or work 
> around existing roads or rivers or factories or houses. 
> You also don’t have to work around existing political processes, 
> community groups, civic organisations ... or even existing 
> regulations and rules."[^growth]
> 
> &mdash; John Macomber, senior lecturer, Harvard Business School.

## Superlinear Scaling 

Each doubling of population correlates to a 15% increase in per-capita economic output.[^west]



## Industrial Agglomeration 

The term "industrial agglomeration" means the clustering of a lot of business firms in one region. Industrial agglomeration leads to "agglomeration economies" (somewhat similar to the seperate idea of "economies of scale"). "Agglomeration economies" are economic benefits that come from having businesses be near each other, such as shared infrastructure development. "Agglomeration diseconomies" are the disadvantages of proximity, such as traffic congestion.


## Improved Resiliency

### <a name="economics"></a>Economic prosperity

Cities should provide **economic prosperity** for the people who live in them and the people who have offices there.

> "Once one starts to think about (the causes of economic growth),
> it is hard to think about anything else."
>
> &mdash; Robert Lucas, Nobel laureate in Economics

* [Jevons paradox](jevons)
* [Marchetti constant](marchetti)
* [Circulation](circulation)
* [Arteries](arteries)

### <a name="economics"></a>Social prosperity

Cities should provide **social prosperity** for the people who live there. It should be:
  * easy to go see your friends
  * easy to do an errand for your mom
  * easy to go to weird new clubs and meetup groups to see who's there

To make those things easy, the city needs to provide good **[mobility](#mobility)**:
  * safe travel from anywhere to anywhere, by anyone
  * fast travel times
  * cheap travel costs

## <a name="mobility"></a>(6) Mobility

To provide good **mobility** the city needs to ensure:
  * safe travel from anywhere to anywhere, by anyone
  * fast travel times
  * cheap travel modes

Good mobility is more important than it sounds. It's not just about making rush-hour traffic a little less tiresome. Good mobility actually has significant implications for:
  * economic prosperity
  * social prosperity

Improved mobility results from unconventional design choices:
  * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
  * **[geometry choices](#geometry)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
  * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

## <a name="transportation"></a>(7) Transportation design choices

The kinematic city design calls for:
  * no traffic lights
  * no stop signs
  * no open roads
  * no large intersections
  * no cars within city limits
    * no private cars
    * no taxis
    * no ubers, lyfts
    * no waymos and self-driving cars
  * no rail within city limits
    * no subways
    * no light rail
    * no trollies or trams
  * no airborne traffic within city limits
    * no delivery drones
    * no helicopters
    * no gondolas
  * no large vehicles
    * no busses
    * no trucks
    * no mass transit
  * no gas engine vehicles
    * no motorcycles
  * no fast vehicles
    * no motorcycles

Instead, we have
  * rain-sheltered pedestrian sidewalks
  * rain-sheltered bike lanes for narrow, low-power, modest-speed vehicles
    * segways
    * mopeds (electric)
    * bicycles
    * cargo trikes
    * scooters
    * skateboards
  
## <a name="layout"></a>(8) Layout design choices

The kinematic city recipe calls for:
  * no single-story ranch houses and no other single-story buildings
  * no skyscrapers and no high rises
  * no suburban sprawl
  * no highways
  * no roads with lanes wide enough for cars and trucks

Instead, we have: 
  * mid-rise buildings of about six stories, similar to Paris
  * roads with narrow lanes for narrow vehicles
  * density of 

## <a name="elevator"></a>(9) Elevator design choices

The kinematic city design recipe calls for:
  * no elevators
  * no stairs
  * no escalators

The only way to go "upstairs" or "downstairs" in a pinq city is by using
  * sloped hallways
  * sloped sidewalks
  * sloped bike paths
  * flights of wheelchair ramps

This idea sounds crazy to most people when they first hear it, because it's so different from all the normal buildings and cities that we're used to.

However, if you run the numbers, and run simulations, it turns out that getting rid of elevators and stairs works out just fine. Instead of making it harder to get places, having no elevators makes it **faster** to get between any two random locations. Plus this design is greener, works better after a natural disaster, can be built more quickly, is less expensive to build, and is less expensive to maintain.
