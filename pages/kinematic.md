## <a name="summary"></a>Summary

 1. We **[need new cities](#need)** in the world.
 
 1. There is **[money available](#money)** for new cities.
 
 1. People are **[rapidly building new cities](#precident)**.
 
 1. Cities can be a **[cost-effective](#cost-effective)** way to:
    * pull people out of poverty
    * bring economic growth
    * meet basic needs
 1. We understand a lot about **[how cities work](#how-cities-work)**.
 
 1. We **[want better cities](#work-better)** for everyone.
 
 1. We can make **[better design choices](#design-choices)**, to make better-working cities.
 
 1. We can get **[better outcomes](#better-outcomes)**.

### <a name="problems"></a> Ten problems of existing cities

  1. cities have too much **traffic congestion**
  2. have **housing costs** that are too high
  3. have **transportation costs** that are too high
  4. are **not safe enough**
  5. are **not good for people's mental health**
  6. are **not resilient** after natural disasters and power failures
  7. overly **limit mobility** of kids, elders, and people with disabilities
  8. are **not quickly alterable** &mdash; making one significant change can take decades
  9. are **not cheaply alterable** &mdash; it is staggeringly expensive to add subways or highways to an existing city
  10. are **too few and too small**, by a factor of two, for everyone who will live in them by 2050

> "Studies have consistently linked city living with poorer mental health. For example, growing up in an urban environment is correlated with twice the risk of developing schizophrenia as growing up in the countryside."[^macdonald]

> "Mental health is almost uniformly worse in cities... that's just what the data shows," [Andreas] Meyer-Lindenberg says over the phone. "There isn't really a bright side to this."[^macdonald]

> "Meyer-Lindenberg is currently tracking how different parts of the city affect our mental wellbeing, using a technique called ecological momentary assessment, in which participants repeatedly report on the environment around them in real time. Various studies have suggested that nature – be that a tree or a park – has an important impact on people’s mental health."[^macdonald]

## <a name="proposal"></a>(1) The proposal for kinematic cities

The proposal here is that new cities that are build from scratch could be built as "kinematic cities". **"Kinematic city"** is a newly made-up name for a specific set of ideas about ways to design cities. No one has yet built a kinematic city. The design revolves around striving to maximize "kinematic range", meaning the number of destinations that are in the daily range of travel for everybody. 

 1. Kinematic cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's **mobility**, travel range, and opportunity, within the city.
 1. Improved urban mobility leads to significant economic improvements &mdash; in wages, GDP, patent applications per capita, etc.
 1. The improved mobility and travel range in the kinematic design results from unconventional design choices.
    * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
    * **[spatial layout choices](#spatial-layout)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps


### <a name="transportation"></a>(1.1) Transportation proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no cars** within city limits
    * no private cars
    * no taxis
    * no ubers, lyfts
    * no waymos and self-driving cars
  * **no rail** within city limits
    * no subways
    * no light rail
    * no trollies or trams
  * **nothing airborne** within city limits
    * no delivery drones
    * no helicopters
    * no gondolas
  * **nothing big**
    * no buses or bus rapid transit (BRT)
    * no trucks
    * no mass transit
  * **no gas engines** in vehicles
    * no motorcycles
  * **nothing fast**
    * no motorcycles
  * **no stops** &mdash; keep traffic flowing
    * no traffic lights
    * no stop signs
    * no large intersections
    * no personal rapid transit, pods, people movers, or things with fixed stops
  * **no freeways**, and no free roads

Instead, we have
  * <a name="bikeish"></a>**bike-sized vehicles**
    * examples
      * bicycles
      * scooters
      * mopeds (electric)
      * strollers
      * cargo trikes
      * wheelchairs
      * segways
      * hoverboards
      * skateboards & electric skateboards
      * cute little delivery robots
    * restrictions
      * narrow &mdash; **36 inch width limit**, or 48 inches for licensed cargo vehicles
      * lightweight &mdash; **111 pound weight limit**
      * underpowered &mdash; **2 horsepower power limit**
      * slow &mdash; **15 mph speed limit** city-wide, with automatic speed governors, and automated ticketing
        > below 18 mph "pedestrians are more likely to survive being hit by a car than die, while at higher speeds the reverse is true" [^levinson]
        > "Small changes in speed have big impacts on fatality rates: a person is 70 percent more likely to be killed by a car moving at 30 mph versus 25 mph." [^ng]
    * mixed-use vehicles
      * Some people may own their own bikes, wheelchairs, or other vehicles, which they can park at home or in parking spaces at their destination.
      * Some people may choose not to own their own vehicles, and instead use vehicle rental services such as Mobike, Lime, Motivate, or JUMP Bikes.
      * Some people may choose to travel in pedicabs or other small vehicles that have a human driver or are self-driving.
    * Innovation is NOT REQUIRED
      * A kinematic city could be built today using off-the-shelf bikes and other vehicles purchased from amazon.com.
    * Innovation IS POSSIBLE &mdash; a kinematic city can incorporate new products as they emerge on the market, sush as
      * new models of electric bikes, scooters, etc.
      * scooters and bicycles that can autonomously reposition themselves from where they are left to where they are needed. (Companies like Tortoise and Uber are working on autonomous scooters.[^dickey])
      * small vehicles that are fully self-driving, like self-driving wheelchairs, go-karts, or other single-person vehicles
      * wireless charging stations at public parking spaces
      * automated congestion pricing
      * battery swapping services
  * **covered laneways**
    * rain-sheltered pedestrian sidewalks
    * rain-sheltered bike-sized lanes &mdash; 5-foot wide lanes, not 10' or 12' wide lines
  * **laneway tolls** & **parking tolls**
    * no tolls on laneways that aren't congested
    * highest tolls at rush-hour, or on busy laneways
    * tolls are per-minute, not per-mile (to prevent slow "street blimp" advertising vehicles)
    * free parking when space is ample
    * highest parking tolls in congested areas
  * common-carrier **delivery lockers**[^quirk]
    * package-delivery lockers, located along the laneways
    * shared by Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and anyone else who would like to use them

### <a name="spatial-layout"></a>(1.2) Spatial layout proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no highways**
  * **no roads** with lanes wide enough for cars and trucks
  * **no empty rooftops**
  * **no single-story buildings** such as ranch houses &mdash; (don't squander land area)
  * **no skyscrapers** and no high-rise residential buildings &mdash; (keep construction costs down)
  * **no private suburban lawns** 

Instead, we have: 
  * mid-rise buildings of about **six stories, similar to Paris**
  * **row-houses** and "walk-up" apartments
  * buildings spaced to avoid dark areas that would be far from windows and skylights &mdash; (keep lighting costs down)
  * buildings with ventilation chimneys &mdash; (keep HVAC costs down)
  * buildings with windows that open
  * a grid of **bike-sized boulevards**
    * rain-sheltered boulevards, each with four narrow bike-sized lanes, each 5 feet wide, plus shoulders
    * grade-separated intersections, so your entire commute has no stop signs or traffic lights
    * a grid of highline trails above the bike boulevards
  * city blocks of about 660 feet by 660 feet
  * about one iconic **landmark structure** per million people, inspired by examples such as:
    * the Eiffel Tower in Paris
    * St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow
    * Big Ben and the tower from the Palace of Westminster in London
    * the leaning tower of Pisa
    * the Space Needle in Seattle
    * the Tower Bridge in London
    * the Makkah Royal Clock Tower in Mecca
    * the Gateway Arch in St. Louis
    * Potola Palace in Lhasa, Tibet
    * Westminster Abbey in London
    * Le Mont-Saint Michel
    * the pyramids of Giza
    * Chateau Frontenac in Quebec


### <a name="ramp"></a>(1.3) Ramp proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no stairways**, no stairs, and no steps &mdash; (don't squander floor space)
  * **no elevators** &mdash; (at $100,000 or more each)
  * **no escalators**

The only way to go "upstairs" or "downstairs" in a kinematic city is by using
  * flights of **wheelchair ramps**
  * hallway ramps
  * sidewalk ramps
  * bike path ramps


### <a name="safety"></a>(1.4) Safety proposal

A kinematic city has:
  * **no gas lines**
  * **no telephone poles**
  * **no overhead power lines**

Instead, we have: 
  * **underground power lines**
  * **911 call response times averaging 3 to 4 minutes**
    > "Improvements in response time and medicine are responsible for about one-third of the reduction in fatality rates from crashes in the UK."[^levinson]

#### Innovation NOT REQUIRED for emergency response

The city boulevards are wide enough to accommodate standard fire engines, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles. The city boulevards are painted with lane markings for narrow 5-foot lanes for bike-sized vehicles, but the boulevards themselves are always 4 lanes wide, plus shoulders. The bikeways have an unobstructed width of about 30 feet, and unobstructed height clearance of 14 feet. The entrance and exit ramps are single-lane, but are still wide enough for standard emergency vehicles. 

#### Innovation IS POSSIBLE for emergency response

Although traditional fire engines can use the boulevards, they may not be necessary. It may be possible for the city to have a larger number of smaller fire-fighting vehicles for different sorts of cargos:
* tender vehicles for hauling water
* pump engines for pumping from sources like canals
* rescue vehicles for hauling floodlights, hydraulic rescue tools, etc.
* hazardous materials vehicles with hazmat suits, etc.

Ideally the kinematic city buildings would all be built with standpipes and fire sprinkler systems, so pump engines and tender vehicles may be less important in a kinematic city, allowing the city to instead have more ambulances, hazmat vehicles and rescue vehicles.

## <a name="work-better"></a>(2) What we want &mdash; things that should work better

> "If we stick to business as usual most of it is going to be 
> disorderly and less functional than the stuff we already have."[^growth]
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

### <a name="design-goals"></a>(2.1) Design goals

* **Carbon footprint.** Because climate change is a serious problem, minimizing carbon footprint needs to be a serious design goal. Carbon footprint goals include:
  * carbon footprint of travel within the city
  * carbon footprint of travel and shipping to and from the city
  * carbon footprint of HVAC in the city
  * carbon footprint of the initial city construction materials and construction work

* **Economic prosperity.** A city should provide for a good life for the people who live in it and the people who have offices there. Because global poverty is a serious problem, economic growth is a force for good, so long as the economic growth is "green growth" and so long as GDP growth goes up while carbon footprint goes down, habitat restoration use goes up, and Gini coefficients go down.

* **Social prosperity.** It should be:
  * easy to go see your friends
  * easy to do an errand for your mom
  * easy to go to weird new clubs and meetup groups to see who's there

* **Agglomeration economies.** The term "industrial agglomeration" means the clustering of a lot of business firms in one region. Industrial agglomeration leads to "agglomeration economies" (somewhat similar to the separate idea of "economies of scale"). "Agglomeration economies" are economic benefits that come from having businesses be near each other, such as shared infrastructure development. But we need our designs to be mindful of avoiding "agglomeration diseconomies", which are the disadvantages of proximity, such as traffic congestion.

* **Affordability.** There's no point in designing a new kinematic city that is too expensive to build, or building a new city that is too expensive for most people to afford to move to. The initial kinematic city designs intentionally focus on avoiding expensive transportation options like light rail, and even bus rapid transit. The designs also avoid expensive buildings, like skyscrapers or even ten-story buildings with concrete service cores and elevators, in favor of less expensive "4-over-1" podium construction.
   - readily available housing
   - affordabability at market prices, without subsidies or rent control

  |---
  | **goals** | **implications**
  |:-:|:-
  | keep construction costs down       | use conventional construction techniques <br> no skyscrapers (expensive per square foot) <br> no elevators  <br> strive for economies of scale 
  | keep land costs low                | pick an inexpensive site <br> maximize Floor Area Ratio (FAR), or floor space per square mile 
  | keep developer financing costs low | use tight construction timelines <br> avoid planning and permitting delays <br> avoid big risks <br> minimize vacancy <br> produce revenue early on <br> do "just-in-time" production of square footage
  | keep transportation costs down     | keep everything close <br> no automobiles (at $20,000+ each) <br> no buses (at $500,000 each, or $8,000+ per passenger seat) <br> no subway cars (at $10,000+ per passenger seat) <br> no subway tunnels (at $100,000,000+ per mile) 

* **Safety.**
  - freedom from harassment
  - safe enough that parents can opt to have "free-range children" who explore the city on their own
  - no traffic accident deaths
  - no fire-related deaths
  - fast response to 911 calls

* **Equity.**
  - equal access to safe passage for everyone through all public space
  - full mobility for women [^gadepalli]
  - no "pink tax" for women [^mccasland]
  - no "trip-range" tax for women [^gonzalez]

* **Accessibility.**
  - stroller-friendly buildings and stroller-friendly transportation
  - wheelchair accessible routes to every part of every building
  - make everything accessible to a variety of wheeled vehicles, from delivery robots to ambulance gurnies
  - predictable navigation for people with limited vision
  - frequent pathside seating for elderly people

* **Proximity.** &mdash; everything within 30 minutes
  - school & work
  - friends & family
  - groceries & restaurants
  - parks & playgrounds
  - gyms & laundromats
  - dentists & doctors
  - libraries & museums
  - long tail destinations (aka _That One Unusual Thing_ that most people wouldn't care about, but that you really want to go to)
    - a monthly Renaissance Faire meetup
    - a weekly Burning Man art car workshop
    - a maker space with an Atomic Force Microscope
    - etc.

* **Airiness.**
  - nearby parks and trees
  - fresh air
  - sunlight

* **Resiliency.** Cities should be designed to be resilient after natural disasters and other emergencies. For example, it should be possible to evacuate a building quickly even when the power is out. And it should be safe to quickly reopen as many buildings as possible after an earthquake, hurricane, or flood. These are goals that can be furthered by simply avoiding "fragile" technologies, like elevators, and traffic lights. 

  > "Resiliency is the ability to bounce back better, but also the ability to not have to bounce back as much." 
  > &mdash; Sylvester Wong, Vice President of AECOM[^new-clark]

  > "Because its location and design were deliberately chosen to withstand natural calamities, New Clark City will serve as the government’s continuity hub, disaster and risk recovery center – an alternative capital city in case a disaster strikes Manila"[^new-clark]

* **Durability** & **Reliability.** Make infrastructure durable and easy to maintain.

  > "even when a [New York City subway] station has an elevator, workers have struggled to keep them working properly. Only about 94 percent of elevators were available in August, according to the transit agency. The rate is worse for escalators -- 87 percent were working." [^fitzsimmons]



* **Simplicity.** Keep systems simple, which helps keep them resilient, durable, and affordable.

* **Impossibility.** Enable new experiences that were not possible before. Enable more people to get to more places. Make more different places to live affordable for more people. Make it safe for little kids to walk to school on their own, without having to cross the street.

### <a name="design-constraints"></a>(2.2) Design constraints

+ engineering constraints
  - daylight available — arctic circle, seattle rain
  - transportation modes available — hyperloop, flying cars
+ market constraints
  - construction costs
  - land prices
+ civic constraints
  - zoning
  - environmental review

### <a name="construction-costs"></a>(2.3) Construction costs

> "the price of construction for an apartment fully equipped with kitchen and bathrooms may cost several thousand US dollars per square meter (about US$2,500 per square meter in New York in 2013 for residential buildings three to seven stories tall)."[^bertaud]

> "In the lowest-income countries, where construction is the cheapest, households would need to be able to afford at least US$6,000 for a studio of 12 square meters; US$6,000 is the global market commodity price for the basic construction materials of concrete and steel required to build 12 square meters."[^bertaud]

> "San Francisco has the world's second-highest construction costs... The city's average construction costs of $330 per square foot was second only to New York, according to a study last year by Turner and Townsend, a construction consultant. Apartments cost around $425,000 per unit to build." [^li]

> "New York and San Francisco topped the list of the most expensive construction markets, costing respectively an average of $354 and $330 per square foot to build. Seattle, which faces many of the same labor market and housing supply pressures as San Francisco, came in at $280 per square foot."[^reid]



## <a name="market"></a>Market context



## <a name="need"></a>(3.1) The world needs new cities

It is estimated that **by 2050**:
* **68% of the world's population** will be living in cities (vs. 55% in 2018)[^growth][^mason]
* about **2.5 billion additional people** will live in cities (vs. 2019), with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* about **200 million climate migrants** will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants]
* **400 million people in India** will migrate to cities[^sharma]
* the **African population will double** from 1.3 billion today to over **2.5 billion** [^forbes]
* there will be at least **nine African "megacities" of 10 million people or more** (and more than two dozen African cities of 5 million or more, about the size of metropolitan Washington), but currently 60 percent of Africa’s city dwellers live in slums [^bloomberg]
* one-third of all of the French Polynesian islands will be submerged[^fast-company]

In California alone, "to satisfy pent-up demand and meet the needs of a growing population, California needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2025."[^mckinsey]

> "Broadly speaking, there is no solution to the California housing crisis without the construction of millions of new houses," said David Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.[^buhayar]

> "The infrastructure here is really tapped," Zuckerberg said Thursday. "Housing prices are way up. Traffic is bad." He added that while Facebook is trying to do what it can to help with what he called the region’s policy challenges, "at this point we’re primarily growing outside of the Bay Area." ... The CEO said he prefers big hubs where Facebook engineering teams could be around one another, and that he doesn’t want to have a lot of small offices around the world, except for where sales teams need to be in the markets they’re serving.[^sumagaysay]

> "58 of the 89 biggest — with headquarters of 100,000 square feet and above — tech and life science companies based in the Bay Area have leased 30.4 million square feet of office space in other U.S. cities since January 2010"[^sumagaysay]

"Half of the urban area that will be needed [by 2050] hasn't been built yet."[^growth]

"Over the next 40 years, the newly built floor area in the world is expected to double."[^watts]

> "we're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"[^growth]
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

### Refugee numbers are increasing

"An estimated 2.4 billion people–40% of the world’s population–live in a coastal region and will likely be impacted by rising sea levels as a result of climate change."[^fast-company]

As of 2018, **70 million people** were currently displaced by war, persecution and conflict. Of the total, 51 million were Internally Displaced People (IDPs), and 26 million were refugees (including **13 million refugee children**). Most refugees live in towns and cities, not rural areas or refugee camps. Nearly 4 in every 5 refugees are in displacement situations that have lasted for at least five years.[^displaced]

> "Indonesia has already announced a $34 billion plan to move its sinking, flood-prone 30-million-person capital to higher ground"[^shepard]

> "There are billions of people living on coastlines that are going to be flooded. It’s going to be worse and worse and worse year by year and they are going to have to move eventually, and where are they going to move to? ... we're going to have to deal with that on a large scale" &mdash Dr. Tom Goreau, president of the Global Coral Reef Alliance.[^shepard]

> "it has been estimated that it’s going to cost the USA alone around $400 billion over the next two decades in sea level rise damage control"[^shepard]


### New cities can help

> "We are at the beginning of the next wave of urbanization — a period of 
> rapid growth in both area and population... The next wave of urbanization 
> will also be defined by its sheer size — a tripling of land cover in the

> Building new cities from the ground up is a bold (and monumentally difficult) 
> attempt to relieve the strain on our currently overloaded urban systems. It 
> promises to build energy efficiency, sustainability, and resilience in to the core of a place."[^caspar]
> &mdash; Caspar Herzberg, Schneider Electric


## <a name="money"></a>(3.2) There is money available for new cities

> "The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. 
> Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of **$100bn** (£78bn), 
> while the country’s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. 
> Malaysia's Forest City had its price initially pegged at **$100bn**, 
> while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking **$161bn**. Adding up the costs of 
> more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment 
> that can be measured in the **trillions of dollars**."[^growth]
> &mdash; Wade Shepard, author and columnist

> "An estimated $100 billion is being invested in new city projects across Africa; [the city of] Diamniadio alone will cost the Senegalese government an estimated $2 billion."[^haas]

> "Google pledged $1 billion to help create 15,000 homes in California."[^gopal]

> "Apple commits $2.5 billion to address California’s housing crisis and homelessness issues"[^perez]

> "South Sudan’s First Vice-President Taban Deng Gai said the government is working on a master plan for the proposed new capital city of Ramciel that will cost the nation 10 billion US dollars."[^tamazuj]

In 2019, U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for **$40 billion** in subsidies, grants, and loans for people in coastal communities who want to either move inland or elevate their homes.[^yang]

### Large private-sector projects

In recent decades we have begun to see the private sector take on very large scale projects, without government funding.

City Center, in Las Vegas, Nevada, is a good example
  * 17 million square feet of mixed use space
  * built in 4 years (2006 to 2010)
  * 100% privately financed, at a cost of **$11 billion** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Banks, real estate developers, and the construction industry are now operating at a level where they can coordinate the successful delivery of very large projects.

In the 2020s and 2030s, is will not be crazy to propose a $20 billion privately funded construction project. The project just needs to pencil out well, be low risk, and meet the needs of customers.

### Public-sector funding mechanisms

There are established public-sector mechanisms for funding development projects, such as Tax Increment Financing (TIF).

> "Portland, Oregon, currently dedicates about 40 percent of its TIF revenues to affordable housing. Over nine years, the program generated nearly **a quarter of a billion dollars for affordable housing**..."[^schneider]

> "The $6 billion Lincoln Yards development in Chicago ... stands to receive **$1.3 billion in TIF funding**"[^schneider]



## <a name="tidal-wave"></a>(3.3) Tidal wave

> "The amount of floorspace in buildings around the world—currently about 2.5 trillion square feet—is set to double by 2060"
> &mdash; Brian Bienkowski [^bienkowski]

The current market size for new city construction is large:
  * in the next 30 years, **another 2.5 billion people** will live cities
  * "averaged over the next thirty-five years, about a million and a half people will be urbanized each week ... the equivalent of another New York metropolitan area [every two months]"[^scale]
  * **120 new cities** are currently being built, **in 40 countries**[^haas]
  * "China ... is on a fast track to build up to **three hundred new cities** each in excess of a million people over the next twenty to twenty-five years. ...  At the present rate it will be moving the equivalent of the entire U.S. population (more than 300 million people) to cities in the next twenty to twenty-five years."[^scale]
  * spending is somewhere between the high hundreds of billions of dollars, and the low trillions of dollars
  * real estate development projects now operate at a scale where it is possible to complete a coordinated, monolithic, **privately financed $10 billion construction project**

> "We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"[^growth] 
> &mdash; Paul Romer

> "This will be by far the largest migration of human beings to have ever taken place on the planet ... The resulting challenges to the availability of energy and resources and the enormous stress on the social fabric across the globe are mind-boggling ... and the timescales to address them are very short."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

> "The UN estimates that each year cities across the world will gain more than 72 million new residents."[^lutter]

> "India, for example, will be home to 7 cities with populations greater than 10 million residents by 2050."[^lutter]

> "projections show that Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, will reach 35 million residents by 2050."[^lutter]


## <a name="precident"></a>(3.4) People are rapidly building new cities

More than **120 new cities** are currently being built in 40 nations around the world[^growth], and 11,000 new buildings are built every day, meaning **4 million new buildings a year** [^metabuild].

  * **Nkwashi**, in Zambia, being built by Thebe Investment Management, is expected to house up to 100,000 people.[^mason]
  * **Tatu City**, in Kenya, being built by Rendeavour, is planned for 150,000 residents.[^mason]
  * **Forest City**, in Malaysia (700,000 residents) 
  * **Enyimba Economic City**, in Nigeria (1.5 million residents)
  * and more than 100 others...

> "Neom is best described as a $500 billion ... plan for a 10,000 square mile area"[^lutter]

> "New Cairo, ... when completed, it could house as many as 5 million residents"[^lutter]

> "Forest City is a $100 billion new city development which will house 700,000 residents when completed. Forest city is a 5600-acre development."[^lutter]

## <a name="cost-effective"></a>(3.5) Building new cities is cost-effective

> "when planned, built, and governed well, cities can be massive agents of positive change," ... "They can be catalysts for inclusion and powerhouses of equitable economic growth. They can help us protect the environment and limit climate change. That is why we need a new vision for urbanization." &mdash; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon [^totaro]

> "Our biggest urban problems today—growing inequality, rampant gentrification, housing unaffordability, and increasing segregation—all have roots in the staggering cost of urban land."[^manhattan]

Projects in existing cities can be staggeringly expensive.
  * **$4.5 billion** for the San Francisco **Transbay Transit Center & Salesforce Tower** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$17 billion** for the **2nd Avenue Subway** project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$20 billion** for the **Hudson Yards** project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$21 billion** for the **Big Dig** in Boston <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$23 billion** for the **Riyadh Metro** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * **$32 billion** to rebuild the **World Trade Center** in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

> "Retrofitting cities, where cities already exist, can be up to three times more expensive than planning for infrastructure in advance of settlement." [^haas]

> "only about a quarter of New York City's 472 subway stations are wheelchair accessible" ... "subway officials ... plan to add elevators at 70 stations in the next five years." ... "The Metropolitan Transportation Authority ... estimates that accessibility fixes will cost about $78 million per station." [^fitzsimmons]

Zoning restrictions in existing cities prevent any large-scale changes to their spatial layout.

> "Three-quarters of the residential land in Los Angeles is restricted to single-family homes, according to UrbanFootprint, software that helps government and businesses understand cities and urban markets. In San Jose, the figure is 94%." [^buhayar]

Building on a new empty, greenfield site is a lot less expensive than building in an existing city. New cities provide more space at lower cost per capita. New cities create value, and demand.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

### New York land value

> "At 305 square miles, New York City makes up only 0.008% of the total land area of the U.S., yet its $1.5tr of housing value is about 5% of the Nation-wide total. Only four states are worth more than New York City, one of which is New York State."[^metrocosm]

> "Manhattan‘s housing alone is worth about $733bn, which would make it the 14th most valuable state in the country. Manhattan measures only about 20 square miles, 7.5% of New York City."[^metrocosm]

> "What I found most striking of all was the value of some Manhattan neighborhoods. The Upper East Side, which occupies less than one square mile, has an astounding $96bn of housing value. That places it above Staten Island and the Bronx as well as above six states: New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and Alaska."[^metrocosm]

* from 1950 to 2015, the value of Manhattan land grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent beyond inflation[^manhattan]

> "The developable land in Manhattan—excluding parks, roads, and highways—was worth between $1.54 and $1.95 trillion, for an average of $1.74 trillion"[^manhattan]

> "Corner lots are significantly more valuable than mid-block lots, according to the study, and lots in close proximity to Broadway, which runs the length of the island, also have higher values."[^manhattan]

### San Francisco land value

> "The San Francisco metro area [the counties of San Francisco, Alameda, Marin, Contra Costa, and San Mateo] is the third most valuable region in America based on the value of its residential real estate. The area's total residential real estate value hit an astonishing $1.3 trillion and it's outranked only by the Los Angeles and New York metro areas, with total residential real estate values of $2.2 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively." ... "San Francisco is one of three cities nationwide that can claim a market value higher than Apple Inc.'s $1 trillion."[^hoeven]

[^hoeven]: ["What's worth more: All of San Francisco's residential real estate or Apple Inc.?"](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2018/08/29/value-sf-real-estate-homes.html). Emily Hoeven, _San Francisco Business Times_. 29 August 2018.


### African land value

> In Africa "we should be building 40 million new homes or 160 Atlantas every year. ... 
> Africa has 54 countries. Altogether they do not build 1 million homes a year. 
> The gap is the opportunity. 40 million modest homes require an investment of 
> more than $1 trillion every year. The multiplier effects would add $10 trillion 
> to annual GDP. That is 5 times current GDP. Closing Africa’s housing gap can

## <a name="how-cities-work"></a>(4) How cities work


### <a name="rules-of-thumb"></a>(4.1) Rules of thumb

* <a name="marchetti"></a>The **Marchetti constant** says that **people tend to travel about one hour a day**. The Marchetti constant is named for Cesare Marchetti, although **it was really Yacov Zahavi** who first wrote about it.

  For people that commute to a job, the average commute is about 30 minutes each way. For people who aren't commuting, it is common to spend about an hour each day on other sorts of trips: chores, errands, appointments, etc. 

  > In the United States in 2013, commuting trips represented only 20 percent of weekday urban trips, 28 percent of vehicle kilometers traveled, and 39 percent of public transport passenger-kilometer traveled.[^bertaud]
  
  The one-hour number seems to be surprizingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. The one-hour constant is believed to have held true in:
  + Ancient Rome
  + Medieval Paris
  + Victorian London — steam train
  + New York — subway
  + Los Angles — car 

  > "Using data from cities across several countries, including the United States, England, Germany, and some developing nations, [Yacov] Zahavi discovered the surprising result that the total amount of time an average individual spends on travel each day is approximately the same regardless of the city size or the mode of transportation. ... we tend to spend about an hour each day traveling, whoever and wherever we are. ... the average commute time from home to work is about half an hour each way independent of the city or the means of transportation.
  > 
  > ... the increase in transportation speed resulting from the marvelous innovations of the past couple of hundred years has not been used to reduce commuting time but instead has been used to increase commuting distances. ... the size of cities has to some degree been determined by the efficiency of their transportation systems for delivering people to their workplaces in not much more than half an hour's time."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

* <a name="jevons"></a>The **Jevons paradox**, or Jevons effect, says that if it becomes possible to use a resource more and more efficiently, then instead of using less of the resource, people actually use more. Total consumption increases because demand increases as efficiency drives the costs down.

* <a name="induced-demand"></a>**Induced demand** says that as the supply of a resource increases, more of it will be consumed. If you add a new lane to a congested highway, it does not reduce congestion, but instead increases the total number of trips made. Induced demand might be better described as **latent demand**. The demand was actually there all along, there was just a lack of supply to meet the demand. The concept of induced demand is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity. I think this is misguided. The existance of latent demand is a sign that we should be striving to increase the supply of transportation capacity, and increase [Kinematic Range](#kinematic-range).

* <a name="feedback-loops"></a>**Feedback loops** will cause either vicious cycles and virtuous cycles in the amount of land area required for roads or other transportation networks.
  * Suburban vicious cycle
    * Suburban sprawl  ➔  longer roads  ➔  more circulation overhead
  * Urban virtuous cycle
    * Dense urban core  ➔  shorter distances  ➔  less overhead

* <a name="linear"></a>**Linear scaling** says that if a city doubles in size, many measurable characteristics of the city, such as the number of businesses, also double in size.

  > "Double the size of a city and on average you'll find twice as many businesses. The proportionality constant is 21.6, meaning that there is approximately one establishment for about every 22 people in a city, regardless of the city size. Or to put it slightly differently, on average a new workplace is created each time the population of a city increases by just 22 people. ... on average, there are only about 8 employees for every establishment, again regardless of the size of city."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

* <a name="superlinear"></a>**15% superlinear scaling** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the economy of the city tends to grow by about 115% (meaning it **more than doubles** in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" in per-capita economic output for everyone in the city.[^scale] This 15% superlinear growth seems to apply to the whole physical and social metabolism of the city, rather than just the economic aspects of the city. The 15% surplus shows up in statistics about:
  * wages
  * wealth
  * patents
  * AIDS cases
  * crime
  * restaurants
  * variety of business services available (meaning, how long the "long tail" of the city is)

  > "... it's illuminating to ask how many different types of businesses there are in a city. ... The data confirm that diversity systematically increases with poplution size. ... an extrapolation of the data strongly suggests that if we could measure diversity to the finest possible resolution it would scale logarithmically with city size."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

  > Economic literature linking the wealth of cities to spatial concentrations is quite abundant and is no longer controversial in academic circles. ... The 2009 World Bank Development Report "Reshaping Economic Geography," and the report of the Commission on Growth and Development "Urbanization and Growth" (published the same year) exhaustively summarize and document the theoretical and empirical arguments justifying the economic advantage provided by the spatial concentration of economic activities in large cities.[^bertaud]
  > &mdash; Alain Bertaud

  > "High-tech invention is extraordinarily concentrated in just a handful of cities. ... The top 10 city-regions account for nearly 60 percent of inventors in biology, chemistry and medicine, with greater New York and the San Francisco Bay Area accounting for more than 10 percent each. Seventy percent of inventors in computer science are in the top 10 regions; the Bay Area alone has more than one-quarter of them. And the top 10 regions account for almost 80 percent of inventors in semiconductors, with one-quarter again in the Bay Area and another 15 percent in greater New York." ... "This clustering of inventors has only increased over time, growing by about five percentage points for biology, chemistry, and medicine, 15 percentage points for computer science, and about 20 percentage points for semiconductors between 1971 and 2007."[^florida]
  
  > "The study finds that when inventors move from a smaller to a large cluster, they experience increases in both the number of patents they generate and the impact of those patents, based on their subsequent citations. For example, a computer scientist who moves from the median cluster to a cluster at the 75th percentile in size would experience a 12 percent increase in productivity, while an inventor in biology and chemistry doing the same would see an 8.4 percent productivity gain. Overall, a just a 10 percent increase in the size of a cluster leads to a 0.66 percent increase in the number of patents produced by a top inventor each year."[^florida]

  > "Third, the clustering of high-tech inventors brings real benefits to the American economy as a whole. ... [Enrico Moretti] estimates that the U.S. would produce about 11 percent fewer patents each year under such a scenario. The country would see a roughly 15 percent annual decline in semiconductor patents, a 13 percent decline in computer science, and a 10 percent decline in biology and chemistry, if the geography of inventors was more equal."[^florida]


  
* <a name="sublinear"></a>**15% economies of scale** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the network of roads, electrical cables, and other supporting infrastructure of the city tends to grow by about 85% (meaning it **less than doubles** in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" economy of scale, both economically and environmentally.[^scale] 

  > "Once one starts to think about (the causes of economic growth),
  > it is hard to think about anything else."
  > &mdash; Robert Lucas, Nobel laureate in Economics 

* <a name="zoning"></a>**TODO: need a name for these notes on zoning, scale, etc.** 

  > In a paper published in 2015, the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti found that, between 1964 and 2009, the high cost of housing in some US cities relative to wages had lowered aggregate US GDP by 13.5 percent: "Most of the loss was likely caused by increased constraints to housing supply in high productivity cities like New York, San Francisco and San Jose. Lowering regulatory constraints in these cities to the level of the median city would expand their work force and increase U.S. GDP by 9.5%.[^bertaud]

  > City clusters already exist of course, like the Randstad in the Netherlands, which links Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The urban development around San Francisco Bay could also be considered a city cluster. What is different with the Chinese concept of cluster is their scale. The Randstad connects only 7 million people, while San Francisco Bay (including Silicon Valley) has only 6.2 million people. By contrast, the urban cluster of the Pearl River Delta already had 65 million people in 2010, larger than the entire population of the United Kingdom but concentrated on less than 10,000 square kilometers! The recent urban cluster including Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei links together more than 105 million people.[^bertaud]


### <a name="units-of-measure"></a>(4.2) Units of measure

**population** and **land area** are examples of common physical metrics for measuring cities.

**GDP per capita** is an example of an common economic metric.

There are a huge number of metrics that people measure cities by. We're going to ignore most of them, and just focus on the handful that are most important for describing the kinematics of cities. 

* <a name="land-area"></a>**Land Area** is the total size of all the land occupied by a city.
  * unit: square miles (or square kilometers)

* <a name="parcel-area"></a>**Parcel Area** is the size of the lot of land that a house (or other building) is built on.
  * unit: square feet (or acres, hectares, or square meters)

* <a name="floor-area"></a>**Floor Area** is the amount of floorspace in a building, including the floorspace on all the different floors of a multi-story building.
  * unit: square feet (or square meters)

* <a name="population-density"></a>**Population Density** usually means the number of people per [Land Area](#land-area). Alternatively, you can also think about density in terms of [Floor Area](#floor-area) per person.
  * unit: people per square mile
  * unit: square feet per person

* <a name="circulation-area-ratio"></a>**Circulation Area Ratio** for a city is the ratio of the total [Circulation Area](#circulation-area) to the total [Usable Floor Area](#usable-area). In New York City, for typical Manhattan city blocks, the streets and sidewalks take up 30% of the land area, with the remaining 70% available for building parcels. Within an office building, hallways, stairs, and elevators typically take up 30% of the [Floor Area](#floor-area) of the building, leaving only the remaining 70% as [Usable Floor Area](#usable-area).
  * unit: square feet per square feet (or square meters per square meters)

* <a name="journey-distance"></a>**D<sub>j</sub>** is a **Journey Distance**, meaning total length of the path taken by a person (or package) as they travel from point A to point B in a building or in a city.
  * unit: feet (or meters, kilometers, or miles)

* <a name="journey-time"></a>**T<sub>j</sub>** is a **Journey Time**, meaning the total length of the time it takes for a person (or package) to travel from point A to point B in a building or in a city.
  * unit: minutes

* <a name="journey-cost"></a>**$<sub>j</sub>** is a **Journey Cost**, meaning the total dollar cost of a trip, including any tolls, train fares, vehicle purchase costs, insurance payments, parking fees, etc.
  * unit: dollars

* <a name="kinematic-range"></a>**Kinematic Range<sub>t=30_minutes</sub>** is the total amount of [Floor Area](#floor-area) a person could possibly get to in a given [Journey Time](#journey-time), such as [30 minutes](#marchetti).
  * units: square feet as of minute (or square meters as of second)

### <a name="kinematic-range"></a>(4.3) Kinematic range

**Kinematic range** is a measure of **mobility**. It's a measure of the capactiy and efficiency of a transportation network. Good mobility is more important than it sounds. It's not just about making rush-hour traffic a little less tiresome. Good mobility actually has significant implications for:
  * job opportunities
  * affordable housing
  * economic growth & prosperity
  * social prosperity

**Kinematic range** is measured in [Floor Area](#floor-area), but it really represents the range of destinations that a person can get to. In the real world, a destination would be something like your friend's house, your dentist's office, or a library or coffee shop.

  * **factors:** kinematic range is a function of lots of different factors:
    * **_starting location_** &mdash; are you starting at the center of town, or out at the edge?
    * **_urban density_** &mdash; how many destinations are there per square mile?
    * **_mode of transport_** &mdash; are you walking, or in a car?
    * **_encumbrances_** &mdash; do you have a stroller, or a wheelchair?
    * **_age_**, **_race_**, & **_gender_** &mdash; can you safely take the subway, or do you need to take a cab?
    * **_time of day_** &mdash; are the trains even running at this hour?
    * **_traffic congestion_**
    * **_travel bans_** & **_security checkpoints_** &mdash; are you allowed into that area?

  * In **Haxby, Montana**, with a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach about a half dozen homes, with perhaps 10,000 square feet of floorspace, so that means your 30-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>30</sub>**, is about **10,000 square feet**.
  
  * In **San Francisco**, if you are able-bodied and travel by bicycle or public transit, but you do not use a car, then in 30 minutes you can probably get from almost any building in the city to almost any room in any other building in the city. But without a car, there are fairly few places you can get to outside the city limits within 30 minutes. The buildings in San Franicsco have a total of about 540 million square feet of floorspace, and your **KR<sub>30</sub>** might be about **450 million square feet**, which is about 50-thousand-fold higher than your range in Haxby.
  
  * **Wurster Hall** is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It's a fairly typical mid-rise building, with a normal mix of offices, meeting rooms (classrooms), and open plan work spaces. Most of the floorspace is in the wider base in the first three floors, but there's a narrower tower that's ten stories tall. The building has a total of about 225,000 square feet of floorspace, and within 2 minutes you can go between almost any two points in the building, so that's a 2-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>2</sub>**, of **225,000 square feet**.
  
  * On the **UC Berkeley campus**, traveling by foot, it takes about 25 minutes to walk between two buildings at opposite ends of the main campus. If it takes another 2 minutes to get from the lobby door of a building to a top-floor room, and vice-versa, that means any two rooms on the whole campus are within a 29-minute range. If the campus has about 10 million square feet of floorspace<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, then your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **10 million square feet**.  

  * In the **US Pentagon building**, it is possible to walk between any two points in less than seven minutes. The Pentagon has 6.6 million square feet of floorspace, so that's a **KR<sub>7</sub>** of **6.6 million square feet**.[^wiki_pentagon] 

### <a name="kinematic-booster-effect"></a>(4.4) Kinematic windfall

This next section is conjectural, so please evaluate it more skeptically.

[Kinematic range](#kinematic-range) almost always increases as cities get bigger. I believe that increase in kinematic range is what drives the [15% superlinear scaling](#superlinear) effect.

> Prud'homme and Lee's paper, titled "Size, Sprawl, Speed and the Efficiency of Cities," shows that productivity per worker is closely correlated to the average number of jobs per worker that are reachable in less than 60 minutes. In Korean cities, a 10 percent increase in the number of jobs accessible per worker corresponds to a 2.4 percent increase in workers' productivity.[^bertaud]

As a city grows, at first, kinematic range increases as population increases, perhaps in a roughly linear relationship. Unfortunately, as cities get too big, they start to sprawl and suffer from traffic congestion. Eventually, there's a **kinematic lag**, where the kinematic range stops its 1-to-1 tracking of population growth, and begins to lag behind.

This whole kinematic cities proposal is all about trying to reduce that kinematic lag in larger cities. The proposed kinematic city design is an attempt to keep increasing a city's kinematic range even as its population grows in the millions.

Take the **San Francisco Bay Area** as an example. The Bay Area is a conurbation that encompasses major cities like San Francisco and San Jose, as well as lots of smaller cities, like Oakland, Berkeley, and Mountain View. The entire population is about 8 million people, depending where you draw the boundaries. 

If you estimate floorspace at about 600 square feet per person, that means there's about 5 billion square feet of floorspace in the Bay Area. Your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be **5 billion square feet**, if you could magically get from any point in the area to any other point in under 30 minutes. But you can't.

As a rough estimate, let's say that from any room in any random building in the Bay Area, within 30 minutes you can reach about one quarter of the other buildings in the Bay Area. That means your actual **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **1.25 billion square feet**.

If we could just improve your travel times, we could quadruple your KR<sub>30</sub> range. If kinematic range is in fact what drives the [15% superlinear scaling](#superlinear) effect, then doubling the KR<sub>30</sub> for the Bay Area would yield a 15% windfall in average hourly wages, patents per capita, GDP, etc. Doubling KR<sub>30</sub> gets you a 15% windfall, and quadrupling gets you **a 30% windfall** (actually more like 32%, because 1.15^2 is 1.3225).

The San Francisco Bay Area GDP was about $535 billion in 2019.[^facc]  A 30% increase would be an **additional $160 billion annual GDP**.

Is it conceivable that the Bay Area could be re-engineered to quadruple travel ranges? Yes, but it would require a lot of changes: maybe a hyperloop, or a lot of Boring Company tunnels. It would be expensive, and it would take decades. For example:
  * the 2013 Bay Bridge Eastern Span, from San Francisco to Oakland, took over a decade to build and cost $7 billion
  * the 1976 BART system was a comparable amount, if measured in today's dollars
  * the 2006 Big Dig in Boston cost $21 billion

Building from scratch has its own challenges, and is also crazy expensive, but it does have the advantage that it can be done much more quickly.

### The solution

The problems above could be greatly ameliorated by just making a handful of different design choices in a new city project:
  * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**
    * what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
  * **[spatial layout choices](#spatial-layout)**
    * the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
  * **[elevator vs. wheelchair ramp choices](#ramp)**
    * stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

### <a name="could-we-build"></a>Could we build a kinematic city?

**Yes.** The kinematic city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

### <a name="why-build"></a>Why build kinematic cities?

If you're starting from scratch, then with a few good design choices it should be possible to build a city that **works far better** than normal conventional cities.

* a kinematic city: 
   1. should have **less traffic** congestion
   1. should have **more commute destinations**
   1. should **thrive economically** compared to similarly-sized normal cities
   1. should have **better air quality**
   1. should be **more affordable** to build than conventional cities
   1. should have **lower operating costs**
   1. should have **lower housing costs**, and potentially **no homelessness**
   1. should be **safer** and more fun to live in
   1. should have **better accessibility**
   1. should be more **kid-friendly**
   1. should be more **elder-friendly**
   1. should have a **smaller carbon footprint** per capita
   1. should be **more resilient** after a natural disaster or other emergency
   1. could be established as a **charter city**[^mason]

### <a name="what-would-it-take"></a>What would it take to build a kinematic city?

Rome wasn't built in a day. Building a kinematic city would take a long time and lot of resources:
  * miles of empty land, clear of conservation restrictions and legal show-stoppers 
  * local government support, and local popular support among the neighbors
  * billions of dollars of start-up capital
  * millions of pounds of steel and concrete, and hundreds of construction teams 
  * a population of people willing to move into the new housing as it is completed
  * a population of companies willing to move into new office space as it is completed

### <a name="could-we-transform"></a>Could we turn London or Paris into kinematic cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

### <a name="could-ideas-trickle-down"></a>Could kinematic ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the kinematic city designs, and make their cities incrementally more kinematic, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

### <a name="do-ideas-impact-democracy"></a>Do kinematic ideas impact democracy and governance?

**No.** The kinematic city designs are politically neutral. The designs are just about transportation systems and about the physical, spatial layout of the buildings in the city.

A kinematic city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a kinematic city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a kinematic city, and they would both be kinematic cities.

For Wuhan, given that the number of vehicles per person is still much lower than that in Sheffield by tenfold ... it is very interesting to note that the average noise levels in all of the sampled areas are lower than those in Sheffield by 2dBA to 11dBA. ... In terms of L<sub>min</sub> and L<sub>90</sub> ... the difference is even greater -- for example, up to 15dBA in the area with a motorway."[^kang] &mdash; Jian Kang

> We see that bicycles provide a much higher road capacity at speeds below 15 km/h than any other mode of transport.[^bertaud]

> In their 2009 book, aptly title Mobility First, Sam Staley and Adrian Moore describe in detail the cross-disciplinary reforms in road and urban transport design and in road pricing, among other things, that would be required to maintain mobility in cities in the twenty-first century.[^bertaud]

> The rent charged should vary with the time of day, the location, the area, and the length of time the road is used. The rent charged for roads should be similar to the fares charged by airlines to passengers or the room rates charged by hotels, except that the rate would not be for a fixed 24 hours but for the number of minutes the roads are actually used.[^bertaud]

### Congestion

> "In a study last year, Inrix estimated that the cost of congestion in the United States alone was $305 billion (USD)" [^turbot]

> "In L.A., nothing concerns locals more than traffic—not personal safety, the cost of living, or even the housing market—according to a 2016 poll by the Los Angeles Times. Drivers there spend an average of 80 hours in gridlock every year, according to a report by Texas A&M University."[^bliss]

> "And New York City, where more than 1.5 million packages are delivered daily..." [^haag]

> In New York City, "Delivery trucks operated by UPS and FedEx double-park on streets and block bus and bike lanes. They racked up more than 471,000 parking violations last year, a 34 percent increase from 2013." [^haag]

> "The main entryway for packages into New York City, leading to the George Washington Bridge from New Jersey, has become the most congested interchange in the country. Trucks heading toward the bridge travel at 23 miles per hour, down from 30 m.p.h. five years ago." [^haag]

> "cars in the busiest parts of Manhattan now move just above a jogger's pace, about 7 m.p.h., roughly 23 percent slower than at the beginning of the decade." [^haag]

> "The average number of daily deliveries to households in New York City tripled to more than 1.1 million shipments from 2009 to 2017, the latest year for which data was available, according to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute [Center of Excellence for Sustainable Urban Freight Systems](https://coe-sufs.org/wordpress/). ... Households now receive more shipments than businesses." [^haag]

### <a name="ramp-notes"></a>Ramps vs. stairs

The idea of having **no stairs** and **no elevators** sounds crazy to most people when they first hear it, because it's so different from all the normal buildings and cities that we're used to.

However, if you run the numbers, and run simulations, it turns out that getting rid of elevators and stairs works out just fine. Instead of making it harder to get places, having no elevators makes it **faster** to get between any two random locations. 

The kinematic city **ramp-only** design:
* is faster and more convenient for people in wheelchairs, and people with strollers
* is faster for everybody else too
* works better for delivery robots
* works better after a natural disaster
* takes up less space in the building
  > In the Seagram building (which has 38 floors), the area used for elevators and utility shafts occupies 31 percent of the area of a typical floor.[^bertaud]

* can be built more quickly
* is less expensive to build
* is less expensive to operate
* is less expensive to maintain
* has a smaller carbon footprint
  > "Lifts also use a large amount of energy to run. For buildings that are largely served by lifts, you can add a rough figure of 5 to 15 per cent onto building energy running costs."[^roaf] &mdash; Susan Roaf


### Speeds

> "the average human walking speed at crosswalks is about 5.0 kilometres per hour (km/h), or about 1.4 meters per second (m/s), or about 3.1 miles per hour (mph). Specific studies have found pedestrian walking speeds at crosswalks ranging from 4.51 kilometres per hour (2.80 mph) to 4.75 kilometres per hour (2.95 mph) for older individuals and from 5.32 kilometres per hour (3.31 mph) to 5.43 kilometres per hour (3.37 mph) for younger individuals" [^wiki_walking]

### Population

> "More recent data, however, reveal substantial urban‐rural fertility gaps (i.e. of one child or more per woman) that tend to be wider at more advanced stages of the fertility transition" [^lerch]

> "In the full sample of countries, rural fertility is almost 20 percent higher than the urban level on average in the pre‐transitional cohorts. ... The ratio increases sharply in the first 20 transition cohorts to 40 percent, stabilizing at this level in the subsequent 10 cohorts. After 30 cohort years have elapsed since the transition onset, the average rural‐urban ratio has dropped monotonically down to 1.23 (in the 55th transition cohort)." [^lerch]

### Economics

> "With the right framework, astonishing prosperity is possible. The independent city of Singapore overtook the world’s GDP per capita in less than 30 years, and that of the USA in less than 50 years." [^free-private-cities]

> "Cities generate roughly 80% of global GDP and are home to more than half of the world's population today, a share that the United Nations projects will reach two-thirds by 2050," the report said. About 40% of the population lives within 100 kilometers of a coast, and one in 10 people live in areas less than 10 meters above sea level, it said. [^khan]


### HVAC

> "The simulations show that the cooling energy demand of the analyzed building in the Greater Accra region is 113.9 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 31% and 50% for the projected climates for 2030 and 2050, respectively. For the analyzed building in the Ashanti region, the cooling energy demand is 104.4 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 6% and 15% for the 2030 and 2050 climates, respectively." [^dodoo]

### Competitions

_Urban Environment Design_ (UED) Magazine's _Hebei International Urban Planning and Design Competition – Xingdong New Area Urban Design International Master Competition_ [^stouhi]

### Bicycles

> In 1896, Susan B. Anthony said bicycling was doing "more to emancipate women than anything else in the world." [^kamiya]

> "No technology holds as much promise as the humble bicycle—especially when we include its newfangled, electrified cousins—to solve the geometry problem that is getting people short distances around a big city." We don't need no flying cars. Just give us a place to ride, and watch e-bikes eat everything. [^alter]

> "Nearly half of American kids walked or biked to school in 1950; today that figure is 13 percent." [^grabar]

### Freight

> "urban planners historically focused on residential travel and personal behavior, failing to integrate the movement of goods into their planning." [^wenzel]
