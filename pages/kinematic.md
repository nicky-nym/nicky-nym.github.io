## Summary

 1. The world **[needs new cities](#need)**.
 1. There is **[money available](#money)** for new cities.
 1. People are **[rapidly building new cities](#precident)**.
 1. Cities can be a **[cost-effective](#cost-effective)** way to pull people out of poverty, bring economic growth, and meet basic needs.
 1. We understand a lot about **[how cities work](#how-cities-work)**.
 1. We could make new **[cities that work better](#work-better)** for everyone, by making significantly better design choices.

### The proposal

Build new cities from scratch that are specifically designed to maximize "kinematic range".

### The problems

Existing cities:
  1. have too much **traffic congestion**
  2. have **housing costs** that are too high
  3. have **transportation costs** that are too high
  4. are **not safe enough**
  5. are **not resiliant** after natural disasters and power failures
  6. overly **limit mobility** of kids, elders, and people with disabilities
  7. are staggeringly expensive to make significant changes to (for things like replacing transportation networks)
  8. take huge amounts of time to make significant changes to

### The solution

The problems above could be greatly ameliorated by just making a handful of different design choices in a new city project:
  * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
  * **[spatial layout choices](#spatial-layout)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
  * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

### The market

The current market size for new city construction is large:
  * in the next 30 years, another 2.5 billion people will live cities
  * 120 new cities are currently being built
  * spending is somewhere between the high hundreds of billions of dollars, and the low trillions of dollars
  * privately financed real estate developments projects are now being completed at the scale of over $10 billion for a single construction project
  * "_We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth_" &mdash; Paul Romer

### <a name="what-is"></a>What is a kinematic city?

No one has yet built a kinematic city. "Kinematic city" is a new made-up name for a specific set of ideas about ways to design cities. A kinematic city design strives to maximize the "kinematic range" of everybody in the city, meaning the number of destinations that are in the daily range of travel for everybody.

 1. Kinematic cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's **[mobility](#mobility)**, travel range, and opportunity, within the city.
 1. Improved urban mobility leads to significant economic improvements &mdash; in wages, GDP, patent application productivity per capita, etc.
 1. The improved mobility and travel range in the kinematic design results from unconventional design choicesL
    * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
    * **[spatial layout choices](#spatial-layout)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

### <a name="could-we-build"></a>Could we build a kinematic city?

**Yes.** The kinematic city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

### <a name="why-build"></a>Why build kinematic cities?

If you're starting from scratch, then with a few good design choices it should be possible to build a city that **works far better** than normal conventional cities

* a kinematic city: 
   1. should have **less traffic** congestion
   1. should have **more commute destinations**
   1. should **[thrive economically](#economics)** compared to similarly-sized normal cities
   1. should have **better air quality**
   1. should be **more affordable** to build than conventional cities
   1. should have **lower operating costs**
   1. should have **lower housing costs**, and potentially **no homelessness**
   1. should be **safer** and more fun to live in
   1. should have **better accessibility**
   1. should be more **kid-friendly**
   1. should be more **elder-friendly**
   1. should have a **smaller carbon footprint** per capita
   1. should be **more resiliant** after a natural disaster or other emergency
   1. could be established as **charter cities**[^mason]

### <a name="what-would-it-take"></a>What would it take to build a kinematic city?

Rome wasn't built in a day. Building a kinematic city would take a long time and lot of resources:
  * miles of empty land, clear of conservation restrictions and legal show-stoppers 
  * local government support, and local popular support among the neighbors
  * billions of dollars of start-up capital
  * millions of pounds of steel and concrete, and hundreds of construction teams 
  * a population of people willing to move into the new housing as it is completed
  * a population of companies willing to move into new office space as it is completed

### <a name="could-we-transform"></a>Could we turn London or Paris into kinematic cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

### <a name="could-ideas-trickle-down"></a>Could kinematic ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the kinematic city designs, and make their cities incrementally more kinematic, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

### <a name="do-ideas-impact-democracy"></a>Do kinematic ideas impact democracy and governance?

**No.** The kinematic city designs are politically neutral. The designs are just about transportation systems and about the physical, spatial layout of the buildings in the city.

A kinematic city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a kinematic city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a kinematic city, and they would both be kinematic cities.

## <a name="need"></a>(1) The world needs new cities

It is estimated that **by 2050**:
* **68% of the world's population** will be living in cities (vs. 55% in 2018)[^growth][^mason]
* about **2.5 billion additional people** will live in cities (vs. 2019), with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* about **200 million climate migrants** will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants]
* **400 million people in India** will migrate to cities[^sharma]
* the **African population will double** from 1.3 billion today to over **2.5 billion** [^forbes]
* there will be at least **nine African "megacities" of 10 million people or more** (and more than two dozen African cities of 5 million or more, about the size of metropolitan Washington), but currently 60 percent of Africa’s city dwellers live in slums [^bloomberg]
* one-third of all of the French Polynesian islands would be submerged[^fast-company]

"An estimated 2.4 billion people–40% of the world’s population–live in a coastal region and will likely be impacted by rising sea levels as a result of climate change."[^fast-company]

Half of the urban area that will be needed by 2050 hasn't been built yet.[^growth]

> "we're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

As of 2018, **70 million people** were currently displaced by war, persecution and conflict. Of the total, 51 million were Internally Displaced People (IDPs), and 26 million were refugees (including **13 million refugee children**). Most refugees live in towns and cities, not rural areas or refugee camps. Nearly 4 in every 5 refugees are in displacement situations that have lasted for at least five years.[^displaced]

> promises to build energy efficiency, sustainability, and resilience in to the core of a place."[^caspar]
> &mdash; Caspar Herzberg, Schneider Electric


## <a name="money"></a>(2) There is money available for new cities

> "The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. 
> Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of **$100bn** (£78bn), 
> while the country’s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. 
> Malaysia's Forest City had its price initially pegged at **$100bn**, 
> while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking **$161bn**. Adding up the costs of 
> more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment 
> that can be measured in the **trillions of dollars**."[^growth]
> &mdash; Wade Shepard, author and columnist

In 2019, U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for **$40 billion** in subsidies, grants, and loans for people in coastal communities who want to either move inland or elevate their homes.[^yang]

### (2.1) Large private sector projects

In recent decades we have begun to see the private sector take on very large scale projects, without government funding.

City Center, in Las Vegas Nevada, is a good example
  * 17 million square feet of mixed use space
  * built in 4 years (2006 to 2010)
  * 100% privately financed, at a cost of **$11 billion** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Banks, real estate developers, and the construction industry are now operating at a level where they can coordinate the successful delivery of very large projects.

In the 2020s and 2030s, is will not be crazy to propose a $20 billion privately funded construction project. The project just needs to pencil out well, be low risk, and meet the needs of customers.


## <a name="precident"></a>(3) People are rapidly building new cities

More than **120 new cities** are currently being built in 40 nations around the world.[^growth]

Examples:
  * Nkwashi, in Zambia, being built by Thebe Investment Management, is expected to house up to 100,000 people.[^mason]
  * Tatu City, in Kenya, being built by Rendeavour, is planned for 150,000 residents.[^mason]
  * Forest City, in Malaysia (700,000 residents) 
  * Enyimba Economic City, in Nigeria (1.5 million residents)

11,000 new buildings are built every day &mdash; **4 million new buildings a year** [^metabuild]


## <a name="cost-effective"></a>(4) Building new cities is cost-effective

Projects in existing cities can be staggeringly expensive.
  * $4.5 billion for the San Francisco Transbay Transit Center & Salesforce Tower <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $17 billion for the 2nd Avenue Subway project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $20 billion for the Hudson Yards project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $21 billion for the Big Dig in Boston <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $23 billion for the Riyadh Metro <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $32 billion to rebuild the World Trade Center in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Building on a new empty, greenfield site is a lot less expensive than building in an existing city. 
  * [TODO: examples]

New cities provide more space at lower cost per capita.
  * [TODO: examples]

New cities create value, and demand.
  * [TODO: examples]

"Our biggest urban problems today—growing inequality, rampant gentrification, housing unaffordability, and increasing segregation—all have roots in the staggering cost of urban land."[^manhattan]

"The developable land in Manhattan—excluding parks, roads, and highways—was worth between $1.54 and $1.95 trillion, for an average of $1.74 trillion"[^manhattan]

from 1950 to 2015, the value of Manhattan land grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent beyond inflation[^manhattan]

"Corner lots are significantly more valuable than mid-block lots, according to the study, and lots in close proximity to Broadway, which runs the length of the island, also have higher values."[^manhattan]

"At 305 square miles, New York City makes up only 0.008% of the total land area of the U.S., yet its $1.5tr of housing value is about 5% of the Nation-wide total. Only four states are worth more than New York City, one of which is New York State."[^metrocosm]

"Manhattan‘s housing alone is worth about $733bn, which would make it the 14th most valuable state in the country. Manhattan measures only about 20 square miles, 7.5% of New York City."[^metrocosm]

"What I found most striking of all was the value of some Manhattan neighborhoods. The Upper East Side, which occupies less than one square mile, has an astounding $96bn of housing value. That places it above Staten Island and the Bronx as well as above six states: New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and Alaska."[^metrocosm]

> In Africa "we should be building 40 million new homes or 160 Atlantas every year. ... 
> Africa has 54 countries. Altogether they do not build 1 million homes a year. 
> The gap is the opportunity. 40 million modest homes require an investment of 
> more than $1 trillion every year. The multiplier effects would add $10 trillion 
> to annual GDP. That is 5 times current GDP. Closing Africa’s housing gap can 
> generate 5 times current GDP!"
> &mdash; Paul Musembwa, CEO of Warp Developments

## <a name="how-cities-work"></a>(5) How cities work


### <a name="rules-of-thumb"></a>(5.1) Rules of thumb

* <a name="marchetti"></a>The **Marchetti constant** says that people tend to travel about one hour a day. For people that commute to a job, the average commute is about 30 minutes each way. For people who aren't commuting, it is common to spend about an hour each day on other sorts of trips: chores, errands, appointments, etc. (The Marchetti constant is named for Cesare Marchetti, although it was really Yacov Zahavi who first wrote about it.) The one-hour number seems to be surprizingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. The one-hour constant is believed to have held true in:
  + Ancient Rome
  + Medieval Paris
  + Victorian London — steam train
  + New York — subway
  + Los Angles — car 

* <a name="jevons"></a>The **Jevons paradox**, or Jevons effect, says that if it becomes possible to use a resource more and more efficiently, then instead of using less of the resource, people actually use more. Total consumption increases because demand increases as efficiency drives the costs down.

* <a name="induced-demand"></a>**Induced demand** says that as the supply of a resource increases, more of it will be consumed. If you add a new lane to a congested highway, it does not reduce congestion, but instead increases the total number of trips made. **Induced demand** might be better described as **latent demand**. The demand was actually there all along, there was just a lack of supply to meet the demand. The concept of **induced demand** is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity. I think this is misguided. The existance of latent demand is a sign that we should be striving to increase the supply of transportation capacity, and increase [Kinematic Range](#kinematic-range).

* <a name="feedback-loops"></a>**Feedback loops** will cause either vicious cycles and virtuous cycles in the amount of land area required for roads or other transportation networks.
  * Suburban vicious cycle
    * Suburban sprawl  ➔  longer roads  ➔  more circulation overhead
  * Urban virtuous cycle
    * Dense urban core  ➔  shorter distances  ➔  less overhead

* <a name="superlinear"></a>**15% superlinear scaling** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the economy of the city tends to grow by about 115% (meaning it more than doubles in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" in per-capita economic output for everyone in the city. This 15% superlinear growth seems to apply to the whole physical and social metabolism of the city, rather than just the economic aspects of the city. The 15% surplus shows up in statistics about:
  * wages
  * wealth
  * patents
  * AIDS cases
  * crime
  * restaurants
  * variety of business services available (meaning, how long the "long tail" of the city is)

|---
| City Population | Average Hourly Wage | Superlinear Scale Factor |
|-:|:-:|:-:
| 40,000 | $16 | (-15%)^4 below $28
| 80,000 | $18 | (-15%)^3 below $28
| 160,000 | $21 | (-15%)^2 below $28
| 320,000 | $24 | -15% below $28
| 640,000 | **$28** | **100% average**
| 1.25 million | $32 | +15% above $28
| 2.5 million | $37 | (+15%)^2 above $28
| 5 million | $43 | (+15%)^3 above $28
| 10 million | $49 | (+15%)^4 above $28

### <a name="units-of-measure"></a>(5.2) Units of measure

**population** and **land area** are examples of common physical metrics for measuring cities.

**GDP per capita** is an example of an common economic metric.

There are a huge number of metrics that people measure cities by. We're going to ignore most of them, and just focus on the handful that are most important for describing the kinematics of cities. 

* <a name="land-area"></a>**Land Area** is the total size of all the land occupied by a city.
  * unit: square miles (or square kilometers)

* <a name="parcel-area"></a>**Parcel Area** is the size of the lot of land that a house (or other building) is built on.
  * unit: square feet (or acres, hectares, or square meters)

* <a name="floor-area"></a>**Floor Area** is the amount of floorspace in a building, including the floorspace on all the different floors of a multi-story building.
  * unit: square feet (or square meters)

* <a name="population-density"></a>**Population Density** usually means the number of people per [Land Area](#land-area). Alternatively, you can also think about density in terms of [Floor Area](#floor-area) per person.
  * unit: people per square mile
  * unit: square feet per person

* <a name="far-parcel"></a>**FAR<sub>parcel</sub>** is the **Floor Area Ratio** for a building on a parcel, meaning the ratio of [Floor Area](#floor-area) to [Parcel Area](#parcel-area).
* <a name="far-overall"></a>**FAR<sub>overall</sub>** is the **Floor Area Ratio** for a neighborhood of a city, meaning the ratio of the total [Floor Area](#floor-area) of all the buildings to the total [Land Area](#land-area) of the neighborhood, including all the land area used for streets and sidewalks and parks, as well as the land area of all the [Parcel Area](#parcel-area).
  * unit: square feet per square feet (or square meters per square meters)

* <a name="gross-area"></a>**Gross Floor Area** is the total floor area of a building, including all the area taken up by lobbies, hallways, elevator shafts, walls, offices, apartments, etc.
  * unit: square feet (or square meters)

* <a name="usable-area"></a>**Usable Floor Area** is an area of a building, such as a studio apartment or dentist's office, that could be rented out to be used exclusively by a tenant, or sold for the exclusive use of an owner. 
  * unit: square feet (or square meters)

* <a name="circulation-area"></a>**Circulation Area** for a building is an area of a building taken up by hallways, elevator shafts, stairways, and lobbies. 
* **Circulation Area** for a city also includes the land area taken up by streets and sidewalks, parking lots, driveways, bus stops, train tracks, etc.
  * unit: square feet (or square meters)

* <a name="circulation-area-ratio"></a>**Circulation Area Ratio** for a city is the ratio of the total [Circulation Area](#circulation-area) to the total [Usable Floor Area](#usable-area). In New York City, for typical Manhattan city blocks, the streets and sidewalks take up 30% of the land area, with the remaining 70% available for building parcels. Within an office building, hallways, stairs, and elevators typically take up 30% of the [Floor Area](#floor-area) of the building, leaving only the remaining 70% as [Usable Floor Area](#usable-area).
  * unit: square feet per square feet (or square meters per square meters)

* <a name="journey-distance"></a>**D<sub>j</sub>** is a **Journey Distance**, meaning total length of the path taken by a person (or package) as they travel from point A to point B in a building or in a city.
  * unit: feet (or meters, kilometers, or miles)

* <a name="journey-time"></a>**T<sub>j</sub>** is a **Journey Time**, meaning the total length of the time it takes for a person (or package) to travel from point A to point B in a building or in a city.
  * unit: minutes

* <a name="kinematic-range"></a>**Kinematic Range<sub>t=30_minutes</sub>** is the total amount of [Floor Area](#floor-area) a person could possibly get to in a given [Journey Time](#journey-time), such as [30 minutes](#marchetti).
  * units: square feet as of minute (or square meters as of second)

### <a name="kinematic-range"></a>(5.3) Kinematic range

**Kinematic range** is a measure of the capactiy and efficiency of a transportation network. Kinematic range is measured in [Floor Area](#floor-area), but it really represents the range of destinations that a person can get to. In the real world, a destination would be something like your friend's house, your dentist's office, or a library or coffee shop.

  * **factors:** kinematic range is a function of lots of different factors:
    * **_starting location_** &mdash; are you starting at the center of town, or out at the edge?
    * **_urban density_** &mdash; how many destinations are there per square mile?
    * **_mode of transport_** &mdash; are you walking, or in a car?
    * **_encumbrances_** &mdash; do you have a stroller, or a wheelchair?
    * **_age_**, **_race_**, & **_gender_** &mdash; can you safely take the subway, or do you need to take a cab?
    * **_time of day_** &mdash; are the trains even running at this hour?
    * **_traffic congestion_**
    * **_travel bans_** & **_security checkpoints_** &mdash; are you allowed into that area?

  * In **Haxby, Montana**, with a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach about a half dozen homes, with perhaps 10,000 square feet of floorspace, so that means your 30-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>30</sub>**, is about **10,000 square feet**.
  
  * In **San Francisco**, if you are able-bodied and travel by bicycle or public transit, but you do not use a car, then in 30 minutes you can probably get from almost any building in the city to almost any other room in any building in the city. But without a car, there are fairly few places you can get to outside the city limits within 30 minutes. The buildings in San Franicsco have a total of about 6 billion square feet of floorspace, and your **KR<sub>30</sub>** might be about **5 billion square feet** (equal to about 460 square kilometers), which is almost a million-fold higher than your range in Haxby.
  
  * **Wurster Hall** is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It's a fairly typical mid-rise building, with a normal mix of offices, meeting rooms (classrooms), and open plan work spaces. Most of the floorspace is in the wider base in the first three floors, but there's a narrower tower that's ten stories tall. The building has a total of about 225,000 square feet of floorspace, and within 2 minutes you can go between almost any two points in the building, so that's a 2-minute Kinematic Range, **KR<sub>2</sub>**, of **225,000 square feet**.
  
  * On the **UC Berkeley campus**, traveling by foot, it takes about 25 minutes to walk between two buildings at opposite ends of the main campus. If it takes another 2 minutes to get from the lobby door of a building to a top-floor room, and vice-versa, that means any two rooms on the whole campus are within a 29-minute range. If the campus has about 16 million square feet of floorspace<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, then your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **16 million square feet**.

### <a name="design-goals"></a>(6.1) Design goals

* **Carbon footprint.** Because climate change is a serious problem, minimizing carbon footprint needs to be a serious design goal. Carbon footprint goals include:
  * carbon footprint of travel within the city
  * carbon footprint of travel and shipping to and from the city
  * carbon footprint of HVAC in the city
  * carbon footprint of the initial city construction materials and construction work

* **Economic prosperity.** A city should provide for a good life for the people who live in them and the people who have offices there. Because global poverty is a serious problem, economic growth is a force for good, so long as the economic growth is "green growth" and so long as GDP growth goes up while carbon footprint goes down, habitat restoration use goes up, and Gini coefficients go down.

* **Social prosperity.** It should be:
  * easy to go see your friends
  * easy to do an errand for your mom
  * easy to go to weird new clubs and meetup groups to see who's there

* **Agglomeration economies.** The term "industrial agglomeration" means the clustering of a lot of business firms in one region. Industrial agglomeration leads to "agglomeration economies" (somewhat similar to the seperate idea of "economies of scale"). "Agglomeration economies" are economic benefits that come from having businesses be near each other, such as shared infrastructure development. But we need our designs to be mindful of avoiding "agglomeration diseconomies", which are the disadvantages of proximity, such as traffic congestion.

* **Affordability.** There's no point in designing a new kinematic city that is too expensive to build, or building a new city that is too expensive for most people to afford to move to. The initial kinematic city designs intentionally focus on avoiding expensive transportation options like light rail, and even bus rapid transit. The designs also avoid expensive buildings, like skyscrapers or even ten-story buildings with concrete service cores and elevators, in favor of less expensive "4-over-1" podium construction.

* **Resiliency.** Cities should be designed to be resilient after natural disasters and other emergencies. For example, it should be possible to evactuate an building quickly even when the power is out. And it should be safe to quickly reopen as many buildings as possible after an earthquake, hurricane, or flood. These are goals that can be furthered by simply avoiding "fragile" technologies, like elevators, and traffic lights.

#### kinematic range &mdash; everything within 30 minutes

|---
|  | **Design implications** | **Examples**
|:-:|:-:|:-
|  | keep everything close      | maximize the amount of usable floor area within 30 minutes of this floor area
|                              | keep traffic flowing       | no stop lights <br> no multi-lane traffic circles
|                              | don't squander land area   | no single-story buildings <br> no parking spaces <br> no private suburban lawns <br> use 4 or 5 foot wide lanes, not 10 or 12 foot wide lines
|                              | don't squander floor space | avoid redundant hallways, stairs, or elevators <br> no empty rooftops



### <a name="transportation"></a>(6.3) Transportation design choices

A kinematic city has:
  * **no cars** within city limits
    * no private cars
    * no taxis
    * no ubers, lyfts
    * no waymos and self-driving cars
  * **no rail** within city limits
    * no subways
    * no light rail
    * no trollies or trams
  * **nothing airborne** within city limits
    * no delivery drones
    * no helicopters
    * no gondolas
  * **nothing big**
    * no busses or bus rapid transit (BRT)
    * no trucks
    * no mass transit
  * **no gas engines** in vehicles
    * no motorcycles
  * **nothing fast**
    * no motorcycles
  * **no stops**
    * no traffic lights
    * no stop signs
    * no large intersections
    * no personal rapid transit, pods, people movers, or things with fixed stops

Instead, we have
  * rain-sheltered pedestrian sidewalks
  * rain-sheltered bike lanes
  * **SLUSHI<sup>[sic]</sup> vehicles** &mdash; Skinny Lightweight Underpowered Slow Indoor Habitrail vehicles
    * scooters
    * bicycles
    * mopeds (electric)
    * strollers
    * cargo trikes
    * wheelchairs
    * segways
    * hoverboards
    * skateboards & electric skateboards
    * little delivery robots

### <a name="spatial-layout"></a>(6.4) Spatial layout design choices

A kinematic city has:
  * no single-story ranch houses and no other single-story buildings
  * no skyscrapers and no high-rise residential buildings
  * no suburban sprawl
  * no highways
  * no roads with lanes wide enough for cars and trucks

Instead, we have: 
  * mid-rise buildings of about six stories, similar to Paris
  * row-houses and "walk-up" apartments
  * roads with narrow lanes for narrow vehicles
  * density of [TODO]

### <a name="elevator"></a>(6.5) Elevator design choices

A kinematic city has:
  * **no elevators**
  * **no stairways**, no stairs, and no steps
  * **no escalators**

The only way to go "upstairs" or "downstairs" in a kinematic city is by using
  * sloped hallways
  * sloped sidewalks
  * sloped bike paths
  * flights of wheelchair ramps

This idea sounds crazy to most people when they first hear it, because it's so different from all the normal buildings and cities that we're used to.

However, if you run the numbers, and run simulations, it turns out that getting rid of elevators and stairs works out just fine. Instead of making it harder to get places, having no elevators makes it **faster** to get between any two random locations. Plus this design is greener, works better after a natural disaster, can be built more quickly, is less expensive to build, and is less expensive to maintain.



## <a name="mobility"></a>TODO: Mobility

To make those things easy, the city needs to provide good **[mobility](#mobility)**:
  * safe travel from anywhere to anywhere, by anyone
  * fast travel times
  * cheap travel costs

To provide good **mobility** the city needs to ensure:
  * safe travel from anywhere to anywhere, by anyone
  * fast travel times
  * cheap travel modes

Good mobility is more important than it sounds. It's not just about making rush-hour traffic a little less tiresome. Good mobility actually has significant implications for:
  * economic prosperity
  * social prosperity

Improved mobility results from unconventional design choices:
  * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
  * **[geometry choices](#geometry)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
  * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

## Glossary

* **charter city**
  * a special jurisdiction with a blank slate in commercial law, to allow for the adoption of new practices in areas such as a business registration, labor law, tax administration, and commercial dispute resolution
  * _typically built on greenfield sites to avoid the challenges of implementing such a wide array of reforms in an existing polity_
  * _typically privately finanaced_
  * see: special economic zone

* **effective altruism**
  * using empirical analysis to direct resources towards efforts that do the most possible good
  * _anti-malaria efforts, deworming initiatives1, and direct cash transfer programs are among the interventions most widely credited with providing the most cost-effective improvement in welfare for the global poor than any other intervention_ 
  * see [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/)

* **induced demand**
  * if you add lanes to a freeway, it leads to more trips, not faster trips[^induced_demand]

* **Jevons paradox**
  * as **X** gets faster (and cheaper), people use more **X**[^jevons]

* **Marchetti constant**
  * people will commute about 30 minutes each way per day [Marchetti constant](marchetti)

* <a name="kinematic"></a>**kinematic**
  * concerned with the motion of bodies, and their range of motion

* **special economic zone (SEZ)**
  * a part of a country in which the business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country[^sez]
  * there have been SEZs since the 1950s, and there are now thousands of SEZs around the world[^mason]
