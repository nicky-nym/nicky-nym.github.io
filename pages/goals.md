# Goals

+ private homes
+ spacious offices
+ parks and trees
+ everything within 30 minutes
  - school & work
  - friends & family
  - groceries & restaurants
  - yoga & gym
  - dentist & doctors 
  - libraries & museums
  - long tail destinations (aka _That One Unusual Thing_ that most people wouldn't care about, but that you really want to go to)
    - a monthly Renaissance Faire meetup
    - a weekly Burning Man art car workshop
    - a maker space with an Atomic Force Microscope
    - etc.

## Best case scenario

+ maximize amount of usable floor area within 30 minutes of this floor area
+ minimize "basement" floor area without windows or daylight
+ maximize trees passed per day
