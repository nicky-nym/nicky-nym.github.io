## Design implications

| Goal | Design implications | Examples
|:-:|:-:|:-:
| affordability | keep construction costs down       | no elevators (at $100,000+ each)
|               | keep land costs low                | pick an inexpensive site
|               | keep developer financing costs low | avoid big risks, and produce revenue early on
|               | keep transportation costs down     | no subway trains, and no cars (at $20,000+ each)
|               | keep HVAC costs down               | pick a mild climate to build in
|               | keep lighting costs down           | design for good daylighting with careful window and skylight placement
|               | prevent real estate speculation    | pick an unconventional city land ownership model

| Goal | Design implications | Examples
|:-:|:-:|:-:
| everything within 30 minutes | keep everything close      | no private suburban lawns

| **Goal** | **Design implications** | **Examples**
|---
| parks and trees | maximize "trees passed per day" | place trees along circulation paths, and make living walls
|                 | provide fresh air               | use windows that open, and pick a mild climate to build in
|                 | provide daylight and sunshine   | design for daylighting, and don't build too far north
