## Design implications

| **Goal** | **Design implications** | **Examples**
|:-:|:-:|-:
| affordability | keep construction costs down       | no elevators (at $100,000+ each) <br> use conventional construction techniques <br> strive for economies of scale
|               | keep land costs low                | pick an inexpensive site
|               | keep developer financing costs low | avoid big risks <br> produce revenue early on
|               | keep transportation costs down     | no automobiles (at $20,000+ each) <br> no busses (at $500,000 each, or $8,000+ per passenger seat) <br> no subway cars (at $10,000+ per passenger seat) <br> no subway tunnels (at $100,000,000+ per mile) 
|               | keep HVAC costs down               | pick a mild climate to build in
|               | keep lighting costs down           | design for good daylighting with careful window and skylight placement
|               | prevent real estate speculation    | pick an unconventional city land ownership model 
|               |  |

| **Goal** | **Design implications** | **Examples**
| everything within 30 minutes | keep everything close      | maximize the amount of usable floor area within 30 minutes of this floor area
|                              | keep traffic flowing       | no stop lights <br> no multi-lane traffic circles
|                              | don't squander land area   | no parking spaces <br> no private suburban lawns
|                              | don't squander floor space | avoid redundant hallways, stairs, or elevators
|                              |  |

| **Goal** | **Design implications** | **Examples**
| parks and trees | maximize "trees passed per day" | place trees along circulation paths <br> make living walls
|                 | provide fresh air               | use windows that open <br> pick a mild climate to build in
|                 | provide daylight and sunshine   | design for daylighting <br> don't build too far north
