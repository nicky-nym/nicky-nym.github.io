## <a name="airiness"></a>airiness &mdash; sun, air, trees

|---
|  | **Design implications** | **Examples**
|:-:|:-:|:-
|  | maximize "trees passed per day" | place trees along circulation paths <br> make living walls
|                 | provide fresh air               | no diesel busses <br> no gas-powered motorcycles <br> use windows that open <br> pick a mild climate to build in
|                 | provide daylight and sunshine   | design for daylighting <br> don't build too far north

## affordablity

|---
|  | **Design implications** | **Examples**
|:-:|:-:|:-
|  | keep construction costs down       | use conventional construction techniques <br> no skyscrapers (expensive per square foot) <br> no elevators (at $100,000+ each) <br> strive for economies of scale 
|               | keep land costs low                | pick an inexpensive site <br> maximize Floor Area Ratio (FAR), or floor space per square mile 
|               | keep developer financing costs low | use tight construction timelines <br> avoid planning and permitting delays <br> avoid big risks <br> minimize vacancy <br> produce revenue early on <br> do "just-in-time" production of square footage
|               | keep transportation costs down     | keep everything close <br> no automobiles (at $20,000+ each) <br> no busses (at $500,000 each, or $8,000+ per passenger seat) <br> no subway cars (at $10,000+ per passenger seat) <br> no subway tunnels (at $100,000,000+ per mile) 
|               | keep HVAC costs down               | pick a mild climate to build in <br> use windows that open <br> use ventilation chimneys
|               | keep lighting costs down           | design for good daylighting with careful window and skylight placement
|               | prevent real estate speculation    | pick an unconventional city land ownership model 

## <a name="propinquity"></a>propinquity &mdash; everything within 30 minutes

|---
|  | **Design implications** | **Examples**
|:-:|:-:|:-
|  | keep everything close      | maximize the amount of usable floor area within 30 minutes of this floor area
|                              | keep traffic flowing       | no stop lights <br> no multi-lane traffic circles
|                              | don't squander land area   | no single-story buildings <br> no parking spaces <br> no private suburban lawns <br> use 4 or 5 foot wide lanes, not 10 or 12 foot wide lines
|                              | don't squander floor space | avoid redundant hallways, stairs, or elevators <br> no empty rooftops
