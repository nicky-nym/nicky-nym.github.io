## <a name="comparisons"></a>Comparisons


### <a name="co2"></a>CO2-e emissions

|---
| CO2-e emissions[^bertaud] | Vehicle type
|-:|:-
| grams per passenger km
| 151 | average US car
|  26 | Nissan Leaf in California
|   5 | Nissan Leaf in Sweden
|  67 | New York subway
| 180 | US urban bus

### <a name="noise"></a>Noise

> "...the population in Wuhan is 8.3 million, much greater than that in Sheffield, at 0.6 million. ... For Wuhan, given that the number of vehicles per person is still much lower than that in Sheffield by tenfold ... it is very interesting to note that the average noise levels in all of the sampled areas are lower than those in Sheffield by 2dBA to 11dBA. ... In terms of L<sub>min</sub> and L<sub>90</sub> ... the difference is even greater -- for example, up to 15dBA in the area with a motorway."[^kang] &mdash; Jian Kang

## <a name="vehicles"></a>Vehicles

### <a name="bicycles"></a>Bicycles

> We see that bicycles provide a much higher road capacity at speeds below 15 km/h than any other mode of transport.[^bertaud]

> Because of their higher speed and increased comfort, electric bicycles, where they are authorized (as in Chengdu, China), could meaningfully compete with buses or cars as a means of commuting in larger cities.[^bertaud]

### <a name="bicycle-sized"></a>Bicycle-sized vehicles

> The emergence of small footprint, on-demand, shared vehicles ... will change the way urban transport is organized. The pattern of roads and arterials may also change to adapt to these new modes of urban transport. Instead of concentric traffic on a few high-capacity highways or arterials, numerous smaller low-capacity roads would allow the flexibility required by trips from dispersed origins to dispersed destinations.[^bertaud]

### <a name="cars"></a>Cars

> "cars in the busiest parts of Manhattan now move just above a jogger's pace, about 7 m.p.h., roughly 23 percent slower than at the beginning of the decade." [^haag]

### <a name="small_cars"></a>Small cars

> By contrast, compared to the motorcycle, compact Smart car performance (except for energy use) in terms of road capacity is not much better than that of an ordinary car. ... The width of the vehicle, not its length, is the important parameter to consider when trying to reduce street area consumption.[^bertaud]

### <a name="pedestrians"></a>Pedestrians

> "the average human walking speed at crosswalks is about 5.0 kilometres per hour (km/h), or about 1.4 meters per second (m/s), or about 3.1 miles per hour (mph). Specific studies have found pedestrian walking speeds at crosswalks ranging from 4.51 kilometres per hour (2.80 mph) to 4.75 kilometres per hour (2.95 mph) for older individuals and from 5.32 kilometres per hour (3.31 mph) to 5.43 kilometres per hour (3.37 mph) for younger individuals" [^wiki_walking]

* walking speed: 2.17 mph up a 1:12 ADA ramp
* walking speed: 2.6 mph UP or DOWN an 1:12 ADA ramp [^sun]

```
tan(27 degrees) = 0.51 => 51% grade = 51 foot rise per 100 foot run

0.73 m/s horizontal on 27 degree stairs => 0.37 m/s vertical = 1.22 feet/sec vertical

## <a name="roads"></a>Road use

### <a name="pricing"></a>Congestion pricing

> In their 2009 book, aptly title Mobility First, Sam Staley and Adrian Moore describe in detail the cross-disciplinary reforms in road and urban transport design and in road pricing, among other things, that would be required to maintain mobility in cities in the twenty-first century.[^bertaud]

> The rent charged should vary with the time of day, the location, the area, and the length of time the road is used. The rent charged for roads should be similar to the fares charged by airlines to passengers or the room rates charged by hotels, except that the rate would not be for a fixed 24 hours but for the number of minutes the roads are actually used.[^bertaud]

### <a name="freight"></a>Freight

> "And New York City, where more than 1.5 million packages are delivered daily..." [^haag]

> In New York City, "Delivery trucks operated by UPS and FedEx double-park on streets and block bus and bike lanes. They racked up more than 471,000 parking violations last year, a 34 percent increase from 2013." [^haag]

> "The main entryway for packages into New York City, leading to the George Washington Bridge from New Jersey, has become the most congested interchange in the country. Trucks heading toward the bridge travel at 23 miles per hour, down from 30 m.p.h. five years ago." [^haag]

> "The average number of daily deliveries to households in New York City tripled to more than 1.1 million shipments from 2009 to 2017, the latest year for which data was available, according to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute [Center of Excellence for Sustainable Urban Freight Systems](https://coe-sufs.org/wordpress/). ... Households now receive more shipments than businesses." [^haag]

> "And it could be just the beginning. Just 10 percent of all retail transactions in the United States during the first quarter of 2019 were made online, up from 4 percent a decade ago, according to the Census Bureau." [^haag]

> "About 15 percent of New York City households receive a package every day, according to the Sustainable Urban Freight Systems center at Rensselaer." [^haag]

TODO: include on this web page some animated images of traffic simulations for the kinematic city design, maybe somewhat like the SUMO simulation output images on this page:
