<span style="font-size:24pt;">a recipe for designing propinquitous cities</span>

---

## Summary

 1. The world needs new cities.
 1. The world is rapidly building new cities.
 1. Building new cities is a cost-effective way to pull people out of poverty, bring economic growth, and meet basic needs.
 1. The cities we are building are not nearly as well designed as they could be, and the size of the opportunity cost is staggering.

## Propinquitous cities
 
 1. Propinquitous cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's mobilty, and opporuntity, within the city.
 1. The improved mobility is the result of a few sets of unconventional design choices
    * choices about the size and shape of city features, such as building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * choices about stairs, elevators, and esclators vs. using simple wheelchair ramps for going up and down
    * choices about what vehicles to use to move people and packages: cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles

## Benefits

 * Propinquitous cities: 
   1. should be more affordable to build than conventional cities
   1. should have lower operating costs
   1. should be safer and more fun to live in
   1. should have a smaller carbon footprint per capita
   1. could be established as charter cities
