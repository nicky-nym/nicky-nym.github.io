# Impossible cities

This paper outlines a summer 2020 design proposal for building car-free cities.

1. **Streets designed for mobility.** 
  * This proposal hinges on a re-design of what a city street looks like, to try to get less congestion, twice the average speed, and twice the total throughput (compared to, say, Manhattan New York). See <a href="#1">chapter 1</a>.
2. **Mobility for prosperity, not for speed.**
  * The main goal of the new design is to increase urban mobility. However, non-intuitively, the benefit is **not** faster commutes, but is instead higher wages & more social opportunities, as well as higher land values & better investment return rates. See <a href="#2">chapter 2</a>.
3. **Bonus features beyond mobility.**
  * The main goal is better mobility, but the design has a variety of other potential upsides. Cities like this should be greener, cleaner, fairer, safer, simpler, and more reliable & resilient. See <a href="#3">chapter 3</a>.
4. **This matters now.**
  * This is an important area of study right now, because there's about to be a huge influx of urban population, and a huge increase in urban construction. The construction of buildings will happen no matter what, so it would be good to try to do it in conjunction with the construction of modern transporation networks, rather than just repeating what was done in past decades. See <a href="#4">chapter 4</a>.
5. **This requires better funding models & better value capture agreements.**
  * Construction is **_very_** expensive. In order to fund the huge amount of construction required for new transportation networks, we need to get much better at **land value capture**. We need to set up reliable "fiscal engines" that can robustly recover the value created on each development project and reinvest it quickly on the next project. See <a href="#5">chapter 5</a>.

## <a name="1"></a><span class="chapter">_Chapter 1_ &mdash; Streets designed for mobility</span>

The Impossible City proposal hinges on a basic re-design of what a city street could look like. 

The Impossible design
  * replaces cars & buses with **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles
  * replaces stop signs and traffic lights with **grade-separated** intersections
  * replaces outdoor, ground-level streets with **elevated, sheltered streets**

The result is:
  * less congestion and **twice the throughput**
  * **50% annual cost savings** over conventional public transit and private car ownership
  * **lower carbon emissions**, quieter streets, and less air pollution
  * **more trees**
  * a bit more available floorspace

The <a href="#1">Impossible street design</a> replaces cars & buses with a wide variety of different kinds of **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles. For this design "bike-sized" means:

  |---

  | **narrow** | 30 inch width limit | 48 inch width
  | **lightweight** | 111 pounds or less | 222 pounds

## <a name="2"></a><span class="chapter">_Chapter 2_ &mdash; Why mobility matters</span>

The [impossible streets & intersections](#1) are designed to yield **faster travel times** and **higher throughput**, compared to conventional city streets in places like San Franisco or Manhattan New York.

### Beyond a faster commute

The goal of the design is to increase overall **urban mobility**, and more specificly to increase everyone's **kinematic range**.

## <a name="people"></a>More space for more people

In the next 30 years, **by 2050**, we expect another **2.5 billion more people** to be living in cities.[^growth]

To handle the influx, cities will build another **2.5 trillion square feet** of new buildings.

"Half of the urban area that will be needed [by 2050] hasn't been built yet."[^growth]

"Over the next 40 years, the **newly built floor area** in the world is **expected to double**."[^watts]

"We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"[^growth] &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

"The amount of floorspace in buildings around the world—currently about **2.5 trillion square feet**—is set to **double by 2060**" &mdash; Brian Bienkowski [^bienkowski]

Constructing even small buildings is expensive. Constructing entire neighborhoods or cities requires not just building housing and office space, but also building all the transportation infrastruction for roads, street lights, traffic lights, bus shelters, subway stops, and more. Plus all of the utility infrastructure, including sewers, water supply, power lines, telephone lines, and the rest.
