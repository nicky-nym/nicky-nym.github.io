# <a name="0"></a>Impossible cities

This paper outlines a summer 2020 design proposal for building car-free cities.

1. **Streets designed for mobility &mdash; better design choices** 
  * This proposal hinges on a re-design of what a city street looks like, to try to get less congestion, twice the average speed, and twice the total throughput (compared to, say, Manhattan New York). See <a href="#1">chapter 1</a>.
2. **Mobility for prosperity, not for speed**
  * The main goal of the new design is to increase urban mobility. However, non-intuitively, the benefit is **not** faster commutes, but is instead higher wages & more social opportunities, as well as higher land values & better investment return rates. See <a href="#2">chapter 2</a>.
3. **Beyond mobility &mdash; better cities & better outcomes**
  * The main goal is better mobility, but the design has a variety of other potential upsides. Cities like this should be greener, cleaner, fairer, safer, simpler, and more reliable & resilient. See <a href="#3">chapter 3</a>.
4. **This matters now**
  * This is an important area for study & discussion right now, because there's about to be a huge influx of urban population, and a huge increase in urban construction. The construction of buildings will happen no matter what, so it would be good to try to do it in conjunction with the construction of modern transporation networks, rather than just repeating what was done in past decades. See <a href="#4">chapter 4</a>.
5. **This requires better funding models & better value capture agreements**
  * Construction is **_very_** expensive. In order to fund the huge amount of construction required for new transportation networks, we need to get much better at **land value capture**. We need to set up reliable "fiscal engines" that can robustly recover the value created on each development project and reinvest it quickly on the next project. See <a href="#5">chapter 5</a>.

## <span class="chapter">_Chapter 1_ &mdash; Streets designed for mobility</span>

The Impossible City proposal hinges on a basic redesign of what a city street could look like. 

The Impossible design
  * replaces cars & buses with **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles
  * replaces stop signs and traffic lights with **grade-separated** intersections
  * replaces outdoor, ground-level streets with **elevated, sheltered streets**

The result is:
  * less congestion and **twice the throughput**
  * **50% annual cost savings** over conventional public transit and private car ownership
  * **lower carbon emissions**, quieter streets, and less air pollution
  * **more trees**
  * a bit more available floorspace

### <a name="bike-sized"></a>Bike-sized vehicles

The <a href="#1">Impossible street design</a> replaces cars & buses with a wide variety of different kinds of **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles. For this design "bike-sized" means:

  |---
  |  | limits for most vehicles | limits for licensed cargo vehicles
  |-:|:-|:-
  | **narrow** | 30 inch width limit | 48 inch width
  | **lightweight** | 111 pounds or less | 222 pounds
  | **underpowered** | 2 horsepower or lower | 4 horsepower 
  | **slow** | 18 mph speed limit city-wide<br>with automated enforcement | 15 mph

## <span class="chapter">_Chapter 2_ &mdash; Mobility for prosperity, not for speed</span>

The [impossible streets](#1) & intersections are designed to yield **faster travel times** and **higher throughput**, compared to conventional streets in cities like San Franisco or New York.

### Beyond a faster commute

You might think that faster travel times would lead to faster commute times, but, surprisingly, that's usually not the case. Instead, when faster travel is possible, most people choose to use it to travel **further per day**, instead of using it to travel for **less time per day**. (See [Rules of thumb: Marchetti](#marchetti).)

In practice, the result of faster travel times is not shorter commute times for everyone, but is instead an increase in daily **kinematic range** for everyone.

### <a name="kinematic_range"></a>Kinematic range

  * **Kinematic range** is a measure of urban mobility. It's the number of destinations you can get to in 30 minutes or less _(or some other set amount of time)_.
  * Different cities have different kinematic ranges
    * In **Haxby, Montana**, there's not any traffic congestion, but there also aren't many places to go. With a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach a total of about **a half dozen homes**, with perhaps **10 thousand square feet of floorspace**.
    * In **San Francsico**, there are lots of places to go, but there's a lot of congestion. In 30 minutes you can reach hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and stores, with perhaps **500 million square feet of floorspace**.  San Francisco has a kinematic range that's about 50 thousand times larger than Haxby, Montana.

```
TODO: add a diagram showing different ranges?
```

<!--
### Congestion vs. kinematic range

  * A **congested** city is one where it's hard to get where you want to go, because there's too much traffic.
  * A **sleepy** little town is one where there's no traffic, but there's almost nothing in town to go to.
  * A **kinematic** city is one that has lots of destinations **_and_** they're all easy to get to.
-->

### <a name="why-does-it-matter"></a>Why does kinematic range matter?

Good mobility is more important than it sounds. It's not just about making rush-hour traffic a little less tiresome. Beyond just convenience, better mobility and kinematic range bring serious changes to the entire metabolism of a city, and to the amount of **opportunity** and **prosperity** available to people.

**For people**, having more destinations within reach means:
  * more **job offers** that are close enough to commute to
  * more **friends** & **family** who are actually close enough to drop by
  * more **schools** to choose from, and more **special classes**
  * more **doctors** to choose from, and a wider variety of **specialists** available
  * a wider variety of **churches** and **religious communities**
  * a wider variety of **events**, **meetups**, and **clubs**, and more people who share your interests
  * a wider variety of **[long tail](#glossary:long-tail)** destinations

**For shops**, **employers**, and **industry**, it means:
  * more **job candidates** to choose from
  * more **vendors** and **parts suppliers** to choose from
  * more **contractors** in different **specialized fields**
  * more **"industrial agglomeration"**, which leads to **"agglomeration economies"** (somewhat similar to the separate idea of "economies of scale")

**For 911 calls** & first responders, it means:
  * **faster response times** and **better incident outcomes**



### <a name="windfall"></a>Kinematic windfall

Around the world, larger cities, with their larger kinematic ranges, tend to have higher wages than smaller cities.

As city size increases, when the number of people (and destinations) in the city grows by 100% (meaning a doubling in size), then the economy of the city tends to grow by about 115% (meaning it more than doubles in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" in per-capita economic output for everyone in the city.[^scale]

This 15% superlinear growth seems to apply to the whole physical and social metabolism of the city, rather than just the economic aspects of the city. The 15% surplus shows up in statistics about:

  * **patents**
  * **AIDS cases**
  * **crime**
  * **restaurants**
  * **diversity of business services** available (meaning, how long the "[long tail](#glossary:long-tail)" of the city is)

```
TODO: comparison of public transit in Singapore vs. cars in Dallas-Fort Worth. (See Velotopia page 44.) 
```

Existing cities, all over the world, have serious traffic congestion problems, despite spending billions on transit projects and on widening roads, in efforts to incrementally improve mobility and kinematic range. As cities grow and economies grow, the congestion problems just get worse.

Cities can improve kinematic range by **moving more people** or **moving people faster**
  * **public transit projects**
    * the **2nd Avenue Subway** project in New York
    * the **Transbay Transit Center** in San Francisco
  * **more highways**, or **more lanes**
    * the **Big Dig** in Boston
  * **more throughput per lane**
    * the **HOV Carpool Lanes** in Los Angeles
    * the **congestion pricing** in London

Cities can also improve kinematic range by **becoming denser**, so that more people and more destinations are nearby
  * **transit oriented development**
  * **dense urban cores**
  * **infill development**
  * **multi-use zoning**

Someday, in the future, cities might also be able to improve kinematic range by using **newly invented transit options**
  * **hyperloop** transit tubes
  * **Boring company tunnels**
  * **flying cars**


### <a name="transit_vs_cars"></a>Transit vs. cars

Here in the United States, in discussions about urban planning and transporation, many people fall into one of two opposing camps:

  * **pro-transit people**, who want to see
    * fewer cars on the road
    * less space set aside for parking
    * more bike lanes and bus lanes
    * more funding for some combination of subways, light rail, buses, bus rapid transit, and other public transit
  * **pro-status-quo "car" people**, who 
    * do not want to lose automobile lanes in return for bike lanes and bus lanes
    * do now want to pay the huge costs of creating and operating public transit systems
    * do not want to take slow, inconvenient, public transit options when they could just drive

In addition to the **pro-transit** camp and the **pro-status-quo** camp, there's also a third camp, of people who are optimistic about new technologies for **automated, on-demand transporation**, like self-driving cars and delivery drones. 

**Proponents** of shared, self-driving cars point to advantages like the greatly reduced need for parking compared to conventional cars, yet the convenience of direct door-to-door routes.

**Opponents** of self-driving cars point to inherently low throughput-per-lane numbers for cars vs. buses and trains, and the real-world congestion problems that we're already seeing from on-demand car-share services like Lyft and Uber.


### <a name="impossible"></a>The "Impossible city" design proposal

Given what we know about the cost and throughput of cars, buses, and rail, and given what we know about the emerging new alternatives, what's the best we could possibly do?

If we could plan a whole urban transporation network from scratch, what's the optimal mix of different transit modes? Which options are the most affordable, and which ones maximize personal mobility, speedy deliveries, and kinematic range?

What follows is a design proposal for what I believe is a **simple**, **cheap**, **reliable**, **low-risk** transportation network that has **high throughput**, good **transit speed**, nearly **door-to-door** convenience, and takes up less space than roads, leaving more **land area** for parks and buildings.

The **Impossible city** is just one simple design for a more Kinematic city. I'm not suggesting that this is the best design; rather, I'm putting it out as a *straw-man* proposal, in hopes that it might be a step in the right direction, and that it might spark conversation that leads to better ideas.

The Impossible design calls for:

  * bikes & **bike-sized vehicles** only, instead of cars, trucks, buses, or trains
  * **electric vehicles** only, instead of gas engines
  * **grade-separated intersections** only, instead of traffic lights, stop signs, or roundabouts
  * **sheltered roads**, sheltered from wind and rain
  * **underground wiring**, instead of telephone poles and overhead power lines

### <a name="look_like"></a>What would it look like?

**A grid**
  * The Impossible design has a **grid of city blocks**, similar to the layout of cities like Manhattan New York. That's in contrast to older cities like Rome and Paris, which have more intricate street layouts, and in contrast to many 20th century suburban developments or new cities like Dubai, which often have more circular or curvy streets, or layouts that are intentionally asymmetrical, with cul-de-sacs and loops.
 
**A big grid**
  * Instead of the rectangular blocks that Manhattan has, the Impossible design has square blocks. Big blocks: more **like big Salt Lake City blocks** than little Portland, Oregon blocks.
  
**With normal buildings**
  * The buildings in each city block would just be normal buildings. They could be mid-rise or high-rise, in any sort of architectural style.

**But with sheltered streets**
  * The "streets" would look very different from normal city streets:
    * They would **not be outdoors**, but would instead be long breeze-way corridors inside a four-story building.
    * They would **not be at ground level**, but instead would be up on the second or third floor.
    * They would **not have intersections**, but instead would be "grade-separated", so that the east-west streets pass above the north-south streets.


### <a name="why"></a>Why is this a better design?

The Impossible design is built entirely around **bicycles**, **bike-sized electric vehicles**, and **sheltered streets** with **no interestions**. At first blush, it's hard to imagine that this is a practical design. It doesn't seem like an entire city could have no buses, trains, or cars, and still manage to move millions of people a day with reduced travel times and increased travel ranges.

It **seems** impossible, because cars **seem** like fast, long-range vehicles, and buses and trains **seem** like high-capacity transit. 

Cars **truly are** fast when they're on highways, but in cities cars are hugely inefficient and ineffective, requiring huge amounts of lane space per car, and traveling with high burst speeds but poor average speeds.

Buses and trains **truly are** high-capacity and high-throughput when everyone on them is going from point A to point B. If you have a group of 50 people who are all gathered together (e.g., at a hotel) and who all need to go to the exact same place (e.g., an office or work site) at the same time, then a bus is a wonderfully efficient and effective choice. But in a city, if people are starting from a variety of different places (different apartment buildings on different blocks), and going to a variety of different places (schools, stores, offices), then buses turn out to have quite poor average throughput.

### <a name="greener"></a>Greener & cleaner

* **smaller carbon footprint** per capita
* **more trees**
* **better air quality**
* **less noise**


### <a name="resilient"></a>More resilient, durable & reliable

* **simpler** &mdash; systems that are simpler, which helps keep them more resilient, durable, reliable, and affordable.

* **more resilient** after a natural disaster or other emergency

* Cities should be designed to be resilient after natural disasters and other emergencies. For example, it should be possible to evacuate a building quickly even when the power is out. And it should be safe to quickly reopen as many buildings as possible after an earthquake, hurricane, or flood. These are goals that can be furthered by simply avoiding "fragile" technologies, like elevators, and traffic lights.

  > &mdash; Sylvester Wong, Vice President of AECOM[^new-clark]

  > "Because its location and design were deliberately chosen to withstand natural calamities, New Clark City will serve as the government’s continuity hub, disaster and risk recovery center – an alternative capital city in case a disaster strikes Manila"[^new-clark]

* **more durable** & **more reliable** &mdash; infrastructure that is durable and easy to maintain.

  > "even when a [New York City subway] station has an elevator, workers have struggled to keep them working properly. Only about 94 percent of elevators were available in August, according to the transit agency. The rate is worse for escalators -- 87 percent were working." [^fitzsimmons]




### <a name="freedom"></a>More free, fair & friendly

* **Freedom.**
  - free-range kids
  - travel without a car & without government intervention

* **Fairness.**
  - a **level playing field** for urban mobility
  - equal access to safe passage for everyone through all public space
  - full mobility for women [^gadepalli]
  - no "pink tax" for women [^mccasland]
  - no "trip-range" tax for women [^gonzalez]
  - more **kid-friendly**
  - more **elder-friendly**
  - more **disability-friendly**

* **Accessibility.**
  - stroller-friendly buildings and stroller-friendly transportation
  - wheelchair accessible routes to every part of every building
  - make everything accessible to a variety of wheeled vehicles, from delivery robots to ambulance gurnies
  - predictable navigation for people with limited vision
  - frequent pathside seating for elderly people


### <a name="social-prosperity"></a>More social prosperity

It should be:
  * easy to go see your friends
  * easy to do an errand for your mom
  * easy to go to weird new clubs and meetup groups to see who's there


### <a name="economic-prosperity"></a>More economic prosperity

* should **thrive economically** compared to similarly-sized normal cities
* should experience a 15% windfall in wages, wealth, patents, land value, etc.

```
TODO: individuals, businesses, governments

    
A city should provide for a good life for the people who live in it and the people who have offices there. Because global poverty is a serious problem, economic growth is a force for good, so long as the economic growth is "green growth" and so long as GDP growth goes up while carbon footprint goes down, habitat restoration use goes up, and Gini coefficients go down.

* **Agglomeration economies.** The term "industrial agglomeration" means the clustering of a lot of business firms in one region. Industrial agglomeration leads to "agglomeration economies" (somewhat similar to the separate idea of "economies of scale"). "Agglomeration economies" are economic benefits that come from having businesses be near each other, such as shared infrastructure development. But we need our designs to be mindful of avoiding "agglomeration diseconomies", which are the disadvantages of proximity, such as traffic congestion.

```


### <a name="affordability"></a>More affordable

* affordable to build
  * vs. subways, light rail, buses, cars
* affordable to operate
  * vs. subways, light rail, buses, cars
* affordable to live in
  * lower housing costs & less homelessness
  * transporation affordability

* **Affordability.** There's no point in designing a new kinematic urban development that is too expensive to build, or building a new urban development that is too expensive for most people to afford to move to. The initial kinematic city designs intentionally focus on avoiding expensive transportation options like light rail, and even bus rapid transit. The designs also avoid expensive buildings, like skyscrapers or even ten-story buildings with concrete service cores and elevators, in favor of less expensive "4-over-1" podium construction.
   - readily available housing
   - affordabability at market prices, without subsidies or rent control

### <a name="incoming-urban-influx"></a>Incoming urban influx

In the next 30 years, **by 2050**, we expect another **2.5 billion more people** to be living in cities.[^growth]

Existing cities are **too few and too small**, by a factor of two, for everyone who will live in them by 2050. To handle the influx, cities will build another **2.5 trillion square feet** of new buildings. These numbers can be hard to believe at first. For different projects by different authors, see the [notes about urban growth](#growth) below.

```
TODO: important quote?
```
> Prud'homme and Lee's paper, titled "Size, Sprawl, Speed and the Efficiency of Cities," shows that productivity per worker is closely correlated to the average number of jobs per worker that are reachable in less than 60 minutes. In Korean cities, a 10 percent increase in the number of jobs accessible per worker corresponds to a 2.4 percent increase in workers' productivity.[^bertaud]

### <a name="kinematic-lag"></a>Kinematic lag

[Kinematic range](#kinematic-range) generally increases as cities get bigger. I believe that increase in kinematic range is what drives the [15% superlinear scaling](#superlinear) effect.

As a city grows, at first, kinematic range increases as population increases, perhaps in a roughly linear relationship. Unfortunately, as cities get too big, they start to sprawl and suffer from traffic congestion. Eventually, there's a **kinematic lag**, where the kinematic range stops its 1-to-1 tracking of population growth, and begins to lag behind.

This whole kinematic cities proposal is all about trying to reduce that kinematic lag in larger cities. The proposed kinematic city design is an attempt to keep increasing a city's kinematic range even as its population grows in the millions.

### <a name="spilt-milk"></a>Spilt milk

Take the **San Francisco Bay Area** as an example. The Bay Area is a conurbation that encompasses major cities like San Francisco and San Jose, as well as lots of smaller cities, like Oakland, Berkeley, and Mountain View. The entire population is about 8 million people, depending where you draw the boundaries. 

If you estimate floorspace at about 600 square feet per person, that means there's about 5 billion square feet of floorspace in the Bay Area. Your **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be **5 billion square feet**, if you could magically get from any point in the area to any other point in under 30 minutes. But you can't.

As a rough estimate, let's say that from any room in any random building in the Bay Area, within 30 minutes you can reach about one quarter of the other buildings in the Bay Area. That means your actual **KR<sub>30</sub>** would be about **1.25 billion square feet**.

If we could just improve your travel times, we could quadruple your KR<sub>30</sub> range. If kinematic range is in fact what drives the [15% superlinear scaling](#superlinear) effect, then doubling the KR<sub>30</sub> for the Bay Area would yield a 15% windfall in average hourly wages, patents per capita, GDP, etc. Doubling KR<sub>30</sub> gets you a 15% windfall, and quadrupling gets you **a 30% windfall** (actually more like 32%, because 1.15^2 is 1.3225).

**GDP.** The San Francisco Bay Area GDP was about $535 billion in 2019.[^facc]  A 30% increase would be an **additional $160 billion annual GDP**.

**Real estate.** The San Francisco Bay Area has about $1.3 trillion of residential real estate. A 30% increase in value would be a $400 billion increase, just for the residential portion of the real estate. Commercial real estate would be roughly another $400 billion. There would also be additional floor space in the roadway buildings, which might amount to another $200 billion, for a total of about $1 trillion of additional real estate value.


Is it conceivable that the Bay Area could be re-engineered to quadruple travel ranges? Yes, but it would require a lot of changes: maybe a hyperloop, or a lot of Boring Company tunnels. It would be expensive, and it would take decades. For example:
  * the 2013 Bay Bridge Eastern Span, from San Francisco to Oakland, took over a decade to build and cost $7 billion
  * the 1976 BART system was a comparable amount, if measured in today's dollars
  * the 2006 Big Dig in Boston cost $21 billion

    * In places with lower construction costs, like the UAE, or China, constructing buildings in a kinematic city would cost about the same as building any other building. 
    
  * **Maybe slightly cheaper**
    * The simplest sorts of kinematic city designs could entirely omit some of the expensive transit systems found in conventional cities, such as subway systems and light rail.

#### New suburbs & satellite cities

TODO:

Perhaps existing cities will absorb nearly all of the 2.5 billion additional people who will live in cities by 2050, but in doing so some of their suburbs will essentially develop into big satellite cities of their own right, so the Kinematic city ideas are relevant for how new developments in those satellite cities are designed.

  * <a name="marchetti"></a>**People tend to travel about one hour a day.**
    * For people who commute, the average commute is about 30 minutes each way.
    * For people who aren’t commuting, it is common to spend about an hour each day on other sorts of trips: chores, errands, appointments, etc.
    * This "one hour per day" number has been found to be surprisingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. This is called the **Marchetti constant** (named for Cesare Marchetti, although it was really Yacov Zahavi who first wrote about it).

  * **As supply increases, consumption goes up.**
    * The <a name="jevons"></a>**Jevons paradox**, or Jevons effect, says that if it becomes possible to use a resource more and more efficiently, then instead of using less of the resource, people actually use more. Total consumption increases because demand increases as efficiency drives the costs down.
    * <a name="induced-demand"></a>**Induced demand** says that as the supply of a resource increases, more of it will be consumed. If you add a new lane to a congested highway, it does not result in reduced congestion and faster trips, but instead results in an increase in the total number of trips made. Induced demand might be better described as **latent demand**. The demand was actually there all along, there was just a lack of supply to meet the demand. The concept of induced demand is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity. I think this is misguided. The existance of latent demand is a sign that we should be striving to increase the supply of transportation capacity, and increase [Kinematic Range](#kinematic-range).[^wiki_induced_demand]


  * **Some aspects of a city scale linearly.**
    * If a city doubles in population size, many measurable characteristics of the city, such as the number of businesses, also double in size. Around the world, from small towns to big cities, regardless of the size of city, there's always about one business establishment per 22 people, and an average of about 8 employees for each establishment.

  * **Some aspects of a city scale sub-linearly.**
    * There are often economies of scale in the infrastructure of big cities (or at least, economies of density). 
    * If a city doubles in population size, meaning it grows by 100%, parts of the supporting infrastructure tend to only grow by 85%. This is tends to be true for networks of roads, electrical cables, and municipal sewers and water pipes.

  * **Some aspects of a city scale super-linearly.**
    * <a name="superlinear"></a>**15% superlinear scaling** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the economy of the city tends to grow by about 115% (meaning it **more than doubles** in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" in per-capita economic output for everyone in the city.[^scale] This 15% superlinear growth seems to apply to the whole physical and social metabolism of the city, rather than just the economic aspects of the city. The 15% surplus shows up in statistics about:
      * wages
      * wealth
      * patents
      * AIDS cases
      * crime
      * restaurants
      * variety of business services available (meaning, how long the "long tail" of the city is)

  > "... it's illuminating to ask how many different types of businesses there are in a city. ... The data confirm that diversity systematically increases with poplution size. ... an extrapolation of the data strongly suggests that if we could measure diversity to the finest possible resolution it would scale logarithmically with city size."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

  > Economic literature linking the wealth of cities to spatial concentrations is quite abundant and is no longer controversial in academic circles. ... The 2009 World Bank Development Report "Reshaping Economic Geography," and the report of the Commission on Growth and Development "Urbanization and Growth" (published the same year) exhaustively summarize and document the theoretical and empirical arguments justifying the economic advantage provided by the spatial concentration of economic activities in large cities.[^bertaud]
  > &mdash; Alain Bertaud

  > "High-tech invention is extraordinarily concentrated in just a handful of cities. ... The top 10 city-regions account for nearly 60 percent of inventors in biology, chemistry and medicine, with greater New York and the San Francisco Bay Area accounting for more than 10 percent each. Seventy percent of inventors in computer science are in the top 10 regions; the Bay Area alone has more than one-quarter of them. And the top 10 regions account for almost 80 percent of inventors in semiconductors, with one-quarter again in the Bay Area and another 15 percent in greater New York." ... "This clustering of inventors has only increased over time, growing by about five percentage points for biology, chemistry, and medicine, 15 percentage points for computer science, and about 20 percentage points for semiconductors between 1971 and 2007."[^florida]

  > "The study finds that when inventors move from a smaller to a large cluster, they experience increases in both the number of patents they generate and the impact of those patents, based on their subsequent citations. For example, a computer scientist who moves from the median cluster to a cluster at the 75th percentile in size would experience a 12 percent increase in productivity, while an inventor in biology and chemistry doing the same would see an 8.4 percent productivity gain. Overall, a just a 10 percent increase in the size of a cluster leads to a 0.66 percent increase in the number of patents produced by a top inventor each year."[^florida]

  > "Third, the clustering of high-tech inventors brings real benefits to the American economy as a whole. ... [Enrico Moretti] estimates that the U.S. would produce about 11 percent fewer patents each year under such a scenario. The country would see a roughly 15 percent annual decline in semiconductor patents, a 13 percent decline in computer science, and a 10 percent decline in biology and chemistry, if the geography of inventors was more equal."[^florida]


  
* <a name="sublinear"></a>**15% economies of scale** is the phenomenon where if a city population grows by 100% (meaning it doubles in population size), then the network of roads, electrical cables, and other supporting infrastructure of the city tends to grow by about 85% (meaning it **less than doubles** in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" economy of scale, both economically and environmentally.[^scale]

  > In a paper published in 2015, the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti found that, between 1964 and 2009, the high cost of housing in some US cities relative to wages had lowered aggregate US GDP by 13.5 percent: "Most of the loss was likely caused by increased constraints to housing supply in high productivity cities like New York, San Francisco and San Jose. Lowering regulatory constraints in these cities to the level of the median city would expand their work force and increase U.S. GDP by 9.5%.[^bertaud]

  > City clusters already exist of course, like the Randstad in the Netherlands, which links Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The urban development around San Francisco Bay could also be considered a city cluster. What is different with the Chinese concept of cluster is their scale. The Randstad connects only 7 million people, while San Francisco Bay (including Silicon Valley) has only 6.2 million people. By contrast, the urban cluster of the Pearl River Delta already had 65 million people in 2010, larger than the entire population of the United Kingdom but concentrated on less than 10,000 square kilometers! The recent urban cluster including Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei links together more than 105 million people.[^bertaud]

  > In the United States in 2013, commuting trips represented only 20 percent of weekday urban trips, 28 percent of vehicle kilometers traveled, and 39 percent of public transport passenger-kilometer traveled.[^bertaud]
  
  The one-hour number seems to be surprizingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. The one-hour constant is believed to have held true in:
  + Ancient Rome
  + Medieval Paris
  + Victorian London — steam train
  + New York — subway
  + Los Angles — car 

  > "Using data from cities across several countries, including the United States, England, Germany, and some developing nations, [Yacov] Zahavi discovered the surprising result that the total amount of time an average individual spends on travel each day is approximately the same regardless of the city size or the mode of transportation. ... we tend to spend about an hour each day traveling, whoever and wherever we are. ... the average commute time from home to work is about half an hour each way independent of the city or the means of transportation.
  > 
  > ... the increase in transportation speed resulting from the marvelous innovations of the past couple of hundred years has not been used to reduce commuting time but instead has been used to increase commuting distances. ... the size of cities has to some degree been determined by the efficiency of their transportation systems for delivering people to their workplaces in not much more than half an hour's time."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

> "...the population in Wuhan is 8.3 million, much greater than that in Sheffield, at 0.6 million. ... For Wuhan, given that the number of vehicles per person is still much lower than that in Sheffield by tenfold ... it is very interesting to note that the average noise levels in all of the sampled areas are lower than those in Sheffield by 2dBA to 11dBA. ... In terms of L<sub>min</sub> and L<sub>90</sub> ... the difference is even greater -- for example, up to 15dBA in the area with a motorway."[^kang] &mdash; Jian Kang




### <a name="growth"></a>Global urban growth

"Half of the urban area that will be needed [by 2050] hasn't been built yet."[^growth]

"Over the next 40 years, the **newly built floor area** in the world is **expected to double**."[^watts]

"We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"[^growth] &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

"The amount of floorspace in buildings around the world—currently about **2.5 trillion square feet**—is set to **double by 2060**" &mdash; Brian Bienkowski [^bienkowski]

It is estimated that **by 2050**:
* about **2.5 billion additional people** will live in cities (vs. 2019), with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* **68% of the world's population** will be living in cities (vs. 55% in 2018)[^growth][^mason]
* about **200 million climate migrants** will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants]
* **400 million people in India** will migrate to cities[^sharma]
* the **African population will double** from 1.3 billion today to over **2.5 billion** [^forbes]
* there will be at least **nine African "megacities" of 10 million people or more** (and more than two dozen African cities of 5 million or more, about the size of metropolitan Washington), but currently 60 percent of Africa’s city dwellers live in slums [^bloomberg]
* one-third of all of the French Polynesian islands will be submerged[^fast-company]

> "This will be by far the largest migration of human beings to have ever taken place on the planet ... The resulting challenges to the availability of energy and resources and the enormous stress on the social fabric across the globe are mind-boggling ... and the timescales to address them are very short."[^scale] &mdash; Geoffrey West

> "The UN estimates that each year cities across the world will gain more than 72 million new residents."[^lutter]

> "averaged over the next thirty-five years, about a million and a half people will be urbanized each week ... the equivalent of another New York metropolitan area [every two months]"[^scale]

> **120 "new cities"** are currently being built, **in 40 countries**.[^haas] These developments are frequently called "new cities", although often they are more like new suburbs or new satellite neighborhoods of existing cities, rather than brand new cities in their own right.

> "China ... is on a fast track to build up to **three hundred new cities** each in excess of a million people over the next twenty to twenty-five years. ...  At the present rate it will be moving the equivalent of the entire U.S. population (more than 300 million people) to cities in the next twenty to twenty-five years."[^scale]

> "India, for example, will be home to 7 cities with populations greater than 10 million residents by 2050."[^lutter]

> "projections show that Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, will reach 35 million residents by 2050."[^lutter]



### <a name="california"></a>California urban growth

In California alone, "to satisfy pent-up demand and meet the needs of a growing population, California needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2025."[^mckinsey]

> "Broadly speaking, there is no solution to the California housing crisis without the construction of millions of new houses," said David Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.[^buhayar]

> "The infrastructure here is really tapped," Zuckerberg said Thursday. "Housing prices are way up. Traffic is bad." He added that while Facebook is trying to do what it can to help with what he called the region’s policy challenges, "at this point we’re primarily growing outside of the Bay Area." ... The CEO said he prefers big hubs where Facebook engineering teams could be around one another, and that he doesn’t want to have a lot of small offices around the world, except for where sales teams need to be in the markets they’re serving.[^sumagaysay]

> "58 of the 89 biggest — with headquarters of 100,000 square feet and above — tech and life science companies based in the Bay Area have leased 30.4 million square feet of office space in other U.S. cities since January 2010"[^sumagaysay]



### <a name="refugees"></a>Refugee migration

"An estimated 2.4 billion people–40% of the world’s population–live in a coastal region and will likely be impacted by rising sea levels as a result of climate change."[^fast-company]

As of 2018, **70 million people** were currently displaced by war, persecution and conflict. Of the total, 51 million were Internally Displaced People (IDPs), and 26 million were refugees (including **13 million refugee children**). Most refugees live in towns and cities, not rural areas or refugee camps. Nearly 4 in every 5 refugees are in displacement situations that have lasted for at least five years.[^displaced]

> "Indonesia has already announced a $34 billion plan to move its sinking, flood-prone 30-million-person capital to higher ground"[^shepard]

> "There are billions of people living on coastlines that are going to be flooded. It’s going to be worse and worse and worse year by year and they are going to have to move eventually, and where are they going to move to? ... we're going to have to deal with that on a large scale" &mdash; Dr. Tom Goreau, president of the Global Coral Reef Alliance.[^shepard]

> "it has been estimated that it’s going to cost the USA alone around $400 billion over the next two decades in sea level rise damage control"[^shepard]



### <a name="precident"></a>"New city" greenfield developments

More than **120 new cities** are currently being built in 40 nations around the world[^growth], and 11,000 new buildings are built every day, meaning **4 million new buildings a year** [^metabuild]. (These developments are frequently called "new cities", although often they are more like new suburbs or new satellite neighborhoods of existing cities, rather than brand new cities in their own right.)

```

  * **Nkwashi**, in Zambia, being built by Thebe Investment Management, is expected to house up to 100,000 people.[^mason]
  * **Tatu City**, in Kenya, being built by Rendeavour, is planned for 150,000 residents.[^mason]
  * **Forest City**, in Malaysia (700,000 residents) 
  * **Enyimba Economic City**, in Nigeria (1.5 million residents)
  * and more than 100 others...

> "Neom is best described as a $500 billion ... plan for a 10,000 square mile area"[^lutter]

> "New Cairo, ... when completed, it could house as many as 5 million residents"[^lutter]

> "Forest City is a $100 billion new city development which will house 700,000 residents when completed. Forest city is a 5600-acre development."[^lutter]



### <a name="cost"></a>Greenfield development vs. retrofitting

> "when planned, built, and governed well, cities can be massive agents of positive change," ... "They can be catalysts for inclusion and powerhouses of equitable economic growth. They can help us protect the environment and limit climate change. That is why we need a new vision for urbanization." &mdash; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon [^totaro]

> "Our biggest urban problems today—growing inequality, rampant gentrification, housing unaffordability, and increasing segregation—all have roots in the staggering cost of urban land."[^manhattan]




### <a name="funding"></a>Funding for new city projects

> "The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. 
> Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of **$100bn** (£78bn), 
> while the country’s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. 
> Malaysia's Forest City had its price initially pegged at **$100bn**, 
> while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking **$161bn**. Adding up the costs of 
> more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment 
> that can be measured in the **trillions of dollars**."[^growth]
> &mdash; Wade Shepard, author and columnist

> "An estimated $100 billion is being invested in new city projects across Africa; [the city of] Diamniadio alone will cost the Senegalese government an estimated $2 billion."[^haas]

> "Google pledged $1 billion to help create 15,000 homes in California."[^gopal]

> "Apple commits $2.5 billion to address California’s housing crisis and homelessness issues"[^perez]

> "South Sudan’s First Vice-President Taban Deng Gai said the government is working on a master plan for the proposed new capital city of Ramciel that will cost the nation 10 billion US dollars."[^tamazuj]

In 2019, U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for **$40 billion** in subsidies, grants, and loans for people in coastal communities who want to either move inland or elevate their homes.[^yang]

### Large private-sector projects

In the past, the truly large-scale new developments have all been done by governments, at least up to now. But until recently that was true for space exploration too. Times are changing.

The global banking and investment system is taking on larger private projects now, computers and the internet enable cheaper and faster R&D, recruiting, project management, etc. Global GDP gets bigger every year, and the world takes on new and bigger projects, both public and private.

Perhaps in the coming decades we'll see increasingly large private-sector real-estate developments. Or, in the public sector, perhaps we'll see some central planning efforts that are looking for big, cost-effective, high-impact solutions to giant housing shortages.

In recent decades we have begun to see the private sector take on very large scale projects, without government funding.

City Center, in Las Vegas, Nevada, is a good example
  * 17 million square feet of mixed use space
  * built in 4 years (2006 to 2010)
  * 100% privately financed, at a cost of **$11 billion** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Banks, real estate developers, and the construction industry are now operating at a level where they can coordinate the successful delivery of very large projects.

In the 2020s and 2030s, is will not be crazy to propose a $20 billion privately funded construction project. The project just needs to pencil out well, be low risk, and meet the needs of customers.

### Public-sector funding mechanisms

There are established public-sector mechanisms for funding development projects, such as Tax Increment Financing (TIF).

> "Portland, Oregon, currently dedicates about 40 percent of its TIF revenues to affordable housing. Over nine years, the program generated nearly **a quarter of a billion dollars for affordable housing**..."[^schneider]

> "The $6 billion Lincoln Yards development in Chicago ... stands to receive **$1.3 billion in TIF funding**"[^schneider]

#### <a name="size"></a>Size & density

  * **Bigger may not be better.** Big cities, with more people, have more destinations to go to, and have a wider variety of destinatations. But, if there's too much congestion, it may take too long to get to the other side of town, so that limits your kinematic range. Your range doesn't cover the whole city, just the region of the city that's within 30 minutes of you.
  * **Denser may not be better.** New York is much denser than Los Angeles, so there are more destinations per square mile in New York than there are in Los Angeles. But it takes longer to travel 10 miles in New York than in does in Los Angeles, so Los Angeles actually has a larger kinematic range than New York.
