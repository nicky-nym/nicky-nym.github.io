## <a name="streets"></a>Elevated streets

The Impossible City design hinges on a basic re-design of what a city street could look like. 

In the Impossible design, we:
  * replace cars & buses with **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles
  * replace stop signs and traffic lights with **grade-separated** intersections
  * replace outdoor, ground-level streets with **elevated, sheltered streets**

The result is:
  * less congestion and **twice the throughput**
  * **50% annual cost savings** over conventional public transit and private car ownership
  * **lower carbon emissions**, quieter streets, and less air polution
  * **more trees**
  * a bit more available floorspace

## <a name="mobility"></a>Better mobility

The [streets & intersections](/streets) are designed to yield **faster travel times** and **higher throughput**, compared to conventional city streets in places like San Franisco or Manhattan New York.

The goal is to increase overall **urban mobility**, and more specificly to increase everyone's **kinematic range**.

## <a name="people"></a>More space for more people

In the next 30 years, **by 2050**, we expect another **2.5 billion more people** to be living in cities.[^growth]

To handle the influx, cities will build another **2.5 trillion square feet** of new buildings.

"Half of the urban area that will be needed [by 2050] hasn't been built yet."[^growth]

"Over the next 40 years, the **newly built floor area** in the world is **expected to double**."[^watts]

"We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"[^growth] &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

"The amount of floorspace in buildings around the world—currently about **2.5 trillion square feet**—is set to **double by 2060**" &mdash; Brian Bienkowski [^bienkowski]

## <a name="costs"></a>Costs & land value

Constructing even small buildings is expensive. Constructing entire neighborhoods or cities requires not just building housing and office space, but also building all the transportation infrastruction for roads, street lights, traffic lights, bus shelters, subway stops, and more. Plus all of the utility infrastructure, including sewers, water supply, power lines, telephone lines, and the rest.
