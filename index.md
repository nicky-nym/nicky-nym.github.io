# Impossible cities

This paper outlines a summer 2020 design proposal for building car-free cities.

1. **Streets designed for mobility.** 
  * This proposal hinges on a re-design of what a city street looks like, to try to get less congestion, twice the average speed, and twice the total throughput (compared to, say, Manhattan New York). See <a href="#1">chapter 1</a>.
2. **Mobility for prosperity, not for speed.**
  * The main goal of the new design is to increase urban mobility. However, non-intuitively, the benefit is **not** faster commutes, but is instead higher wages & more social opportunities, as well as higher land values & better investment return rates. See <a href="#2">chapter 2</a>.
3. **Bonus features beyond mobility.**
  * The main goal is better mobility, but the design has a variety of other potential upsides. Cities like this should be greener, cleaner, fairer, safer, simpler, and more reliable & resilient. See <a href="#3">chapter 3</a>.
4. **This matters now.**
  * This is an important area of study right now, because there's about to be a huge influx of urban population, and a huge increase in urban construction. The construction of buildings will happen no matter what, so it would be good to try to do it in conjunction with the construction of modern transporation networks, rather than just repeating what was done in past decades. See <a href="#4">chapter 4</a>.
5. **This requires better funding models & better value capture agreements.**
  * Construction is **_very_** expensive. In order to fund the huge amount of construction required for new transportation networks, we need to get much better at **land value capture**. We need to set up reliable "fiscal engines" that can robustly recover the value created on each development project and reinvest it quickly on the next project. See <a href="#5">chapter 5</a>.

## <a name="1"></a><span class="chapter">_Chapter 1_ &mdash; Streets designed for mobility</span>

The Impossible City proposal hinges on a basic re-design of what a city street could look like. 

The Impossible design
  * replaces cars & buses with **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles
  * replaces stop signs and traffic lights with **grade-separated** intersections
  * replaces outdoor, ground-level streets with **elevated, sheltered streets**

The result is:
  * less congestion and **twice the throughput**
  * **50% annual cost savings** over conventional public transit and private car ownership
  * **lower carbon emissions**, quieter streets, and less air pollution
  * **more trees**
  * a bit more available floorspace

### <a name="bike-sized"></a>Bike-sized vehicles

The <a href="#1">Impossible street design</a> replaces cars & buses with a wide variety of different kinds of **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles. For this design "bike-sized" means:

  |---
  |  | limits for most vehicles | limits for licensed cargo vehicles
  |-:|:-|:-
  | **narrow** | 30 inch width limit | 48 inch width
  | **lightweight** | 111 pounds or less | 222 pounds
  | **underpowered** | 2 horsepower or lower | 4 horsepower 
  | **slow** | 18 mph speed limit city-wide<br>with automated enforcement | 15 mph

## <a name="2"></a><span class="chapter">_Chapter 2_ &mdash; Mobility for prosperity, not for speed</span>

The [impossible streets & intersections](#1) are designed to yield **faster travel times** and **higher throughput**, compared to conventional city streets in places like San Franisco or Manhattan New York.

### Beyond a faster commute

You might think that faster travel times would lead to faster commute times, but, surprisingly, that's usually not the case. Instead, when faster travel is possible, most people choose to use it to travel **further per day**, instead of using it to travel for **less time per day**.

The result of faster travel times is not shorter commute times for everyone, but is instead an increase in daily **kinematic range** for everyone.

### <a name="congestion"></a>Congestion vs. kinematic range

  * A **congested** city is one where it's hard to get where you want to go, because there's too much traffic.
  * A **sleepy** little town is one where there's no traffic, but there's almost nothing in town to go to.
  * A **kinematic** city is one that has lots of destinations **_and_** they're all easy to get to.

### <a name="kinematic_range"></a>Kinematic range

  * **Kinematic range** is a measure of urban mobility. It's the number of destinations you can get to in 30 minutes or less _(or some other set time)_.
  * Different cities have different kinematic ranges
    * In **Haxby, Montana**, there's not any traffic congestion, but there also aren't many places to go. With a car, in 30 minutes you can probably reach a total of about **a half dozen homes**, with perhaps **10 thousand square feet of floorspace**.
    * In **San Francsico**, there are lots of places to go, but there's a lot of congestion. In 30 minutes you can reach hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and stores, with perhaps **500 million square feet of floorspace**.  San Francisco has a kinematic range that's about 50 thousand times larger than Haxby, Montana.


### <a name="who_cares"></a>Why does Kinematic Range matter?

  * Urban mobility is *important*

  * **For people**, having more destinations within reach means:
    * more **job offers** that are close enough to commute to
    * more **friends** & **family** who are actually close enough to drop by
    * more **schools** to choose from, and more **special classes**
    * more **doctors** to choose from, and a wider variety of **specialists** available
    * a wider variety of **churches** and **religious communities**
    * a wider variety of **events**, **meetups**, and **clubs**, and more people who share your interests
    * a wider variety of **[long tail](/glossary#long-tail)** destinations
  * **For shops**, **employers**, and **industry**, it means:
    * more **job candidates** to choose from
    * more **vendors** and **parts suppliers** to choose from
    * more **contractors** in different **specialized fields**
    * more **"industrial agglomeration"**, which leads to **"agglomeration economies"** (somewhat similar to the separate idea of "economies of scale")
  * **For 911 calls** & first responders, it means:
    * **faster response times** and **better incident outcomes**

### <a name="convenience"></a>Convenience, opportunity, prosperity

**Convenience** is one benefit of better urban mobility. Having more destinations in your kinematic range means it's easier to do the things you want to do.

Beyond just convenience, better mobility and kinematic range bring serious changes to the entire metabolism of a city, and to the amount of **opportunity** and **prosperity** available to people. 

### <a name="dividend"></a>15% dividend per doubling

Around the world, larger cities, with their larger kinematic ranges, tend to have higher wages than smaller cities.

As city size increases, when the number of people (and destinations) in the city grows by 100% (meaning a doubling in size), then the economy of the city tends to grow by about 115% (meaning it more than doubles in size), so that there is effectively a 15% "bonus" in per-capita economic output for everyone in the city.[^scale]

This 15% superlinear growth seems to apply to the whole physical and social metabolism of the city, rather than just the economic aspects of the city. The 15% surplus shows up in statistics about:
  * **wages**
  * **wealth**
  * **patents**
  * **AIDS cases**
  * **crime**
  * **restaurants**
  * **diversity of business services** available (meaning, how long the "[long tail](/glossary#long-tail)" of the city is)

### <a name="incrementalist"></a>How do existing cities try to become more Kinematic?

Existing cities work hard, and spend billions, to try to incrementally improve mobility and kinematic range.

Cities can improve kinematic range by **moving more people** or **moving people faster**
  * **public transit projects**
    * the **2nd Avenue Subway** project in New York, 
    * the **Transbay Transit Center** in San Francisco, 
  * **more highways**, or **more lanes**
    * the **Big Dig** in Boston, 
  * **more throughput per lane**
    * the **HOV Carpool Lanes** in Los Angeles, 
    * the **congestion pricing** in Londo*

Cities can also improve kinematic range by **becoming denser**, so that more people and more destinations are nearby
  * **transit oriented development**
  * **dense urban cores**
  * **infill development**
  * **multi-use zoning**

### <a name="future"></a>Future possibilities

Someday, in the future, cities might also be able to improve kinematic range by using **newly invented transit options**
  * **hyperloop** transit tubes
  * **Boring company tunnels**
  * **flying cars**


### <a name="better"></a>Could we do better?

Existing cities, all over the world, have serious traffic congestion problems, despite spending billions on transit projects and on widening roads. As cities grow and economies grow, the congestion problems just get worse.

### <a name="transit_vs_cars"></a>Transit vs. cars

Here in the United States, in discussions about urban planning and transporation, many people fall into one of two opposing camps:

  * **pro-transit people** , who want to see
    * fewer cars on the road
    * less space set aside for parking
    * more bike lanes and bus lanes
    * more funding for some combination of subways, light rail, buses, bus rapid transit, and other public transit
  * **pro-status-quo "car" people**, who 
    * do not want to lose automobile lanes in return for bike lanes and bus lanes
    * do now want to pay the huge costs of creating and operating public transit systems
    * do not want to take slow, inconvenient, public transit options when they could just drive

### <a name="self_driving"></a>Self-driving cars & delivery drones

In addition to the **pro-transit** camp and the **pro-status-quo** camp, there's also a third camp, of people who are optimistic about new technologies for **automated, on-demand transporation**, like self-driving cars and delivery drones. 

**Proponents** of shared, self-driving cars point to advantages like the greatly reduced need for parking compared to conventional cars, yet the convenience of direct door-to-door routes.

**Opponents** of self-driving cars point to inherently low throughput-per-lane numbers for cars vs. buses and trains, and the real-world congestion problems that we're already seeing from on-demand car-share services like Lyft and Uber.

### <a name="micromobility"></a>Scooters & micromobility

Cities around the world are experimenting with whole range of other new transportation options, from dockless rental scooters to designated bike-share stations. The advent of electric bikes and electric scooters also opens new possibilities.

### <a name="best"></a>The best we could do...

Given what we know about the cost and throughput of cars, buses, and rail, and given what we know about the emerging new alternatives, what's the best we could possibly do?

If we could plan a whole urban transporation network from scratch, what's the optimal mix of different transit modes? Which options are the most affordable, and which ones maximize personal mobility, speedy deliveries, and kinematic range?

What follows is a design proposal for what I believe is a **simple**, **cheap**, **reliable**, **low-risk** transportation network that has **high throughput**, good **transit speed**, nearly **door-to-door** convenience, and takes up less space than roads, leaving more **land area** for parks and buildings.


### <a name="impossible"></a>"Impossible city" design proposal

The **Impossible city** is just one simple design for a more Kinematic city. I'm not suggesting that this is the best design; rather, I'm putting it out as a *straw-man* proposal, in hopes that it might be a step in the right direction, and that it might spark conversation that leads to better ideas.

### <a name="goals"></a>What are the design goals?

  * improved overall **urban mobility** & **kinematic range**
    * realize a 15% dividend in wages, wealth, patents, land value, etc.
    * increase economic prosperity
    * increase social prosperity
  * **more affordable** transportation and housing 
  * a **level playing field** for urban mobility
    * more **kid-friendly**
    * more **elder-friendly**
    * more **accessible** for people with disabilites
  * a **cleaner**, **quieter**, **safer** city
  * reduced **carbon footprint** and **air pollution**
  * a **more resilient** city and after natural disasters and power failures
  * **simplicity**, **durability**, and **reliability**
    
### <a name="features"></a>What are the main design features?

The Impossible design calls for:

  * bikes & **bike-sized vehicles** only, instead of cars, trucks, buses, or trains
  * **electric vehicles** only, instead of gas engines
  * **grade-separated intersections** only, instead of traffic lights, stop signs, or roundabouts
  * **sheltered roads**, sheltered from wind and rain
  * **underground wiring**, instead of telephone poles and overhead power lines

### <a name="look_like"></a>What would it look like?

**A grid**
  * The Impossible design has a **grid of city blocks**, similar to the layout of cities like Manhattan New York. That's in contrast to older cities like Rome and Paris, which have more intricate street layouts, and in contrast to many 20th century suburban developments or new cities like Dubai, which often have more circular or curvy streets, or layouts that are intentionally asymmetrical, with cul-de-sacs and loops.
 
**A big grid**
  * Instead of the rectangular blocks that Manhattan has, the Impossible design has square blocks. Big blocks: more **like big Salt Lake City blocks** than little Portland, Oregon blocks.
  
**With normal buildings**
  * The buildings in each city block would just be normal buildings. They could be mid-rise or high-rise, in any sort of architectural style.

**But with sheltered streets**
  * The "streets" would look very different from normal city streets:
    * They would **not be outdoors**, but would instead be long breeze-way corridors inside a four-story building.
    * They would **not be at ground level**, but instead would be up on the second or third floor.
    * They would **not have intersections**, but instead would be "grade-separated", so that the east-west streets pass above the north-south streets.


### <a name="why"></a>Why is this a better design?

The Impossible design is built entirely around **bicycles**, **bike-sized electric vehicles**, and **sheltered streets** with **no interestions**. At first blush, it's hard to imagine that this is a practical design. It doesn't seem like an entire city could have no buses, trains, or cars, and still manage to move millions of people a day with reduced travel times and increased travel ranges.

It **seems** impossible, because cars **seem** like fast, long-range vehicles, and buses and trains **seem** like high-capacity transit. 

Cars **truly are** fast when they're on highways, but in cities cars are hugely inefficient and ineffective, requiring huge amounts of lane space per car, and traveling with high burst speeds but poor average speeds.

Buses and trains **truly are** high-capacity and high-throughput when everyone on them is going from point A to point B. If you have a group of 50 people who are all gathered together (e.g., at a hotel) and who all need to go to the exact same place (e.g., an office or work site) at the same time, then a bus is a wonderfully efficient and effective choice. But in a city, if people are starting from a variety of different places (different apartment buildings on different blocks), and going to a variety of different places (schools, stores, offices), then buses turn out to have quite poor average throughput.


### <a name="how"></a>How do you know this is better?

By building models and running simulations, and by combing through the available statistics about the different existing transportation modes in different cities.


### <a name="where"></a>Where would it be?

**Anywhere:** The impossible design does not depend on a particular climate, or on particular building materials. It's an anywhere-in-the world city, not just a European city, an African city, or an Arctic city.

It could be built on the outskirts of an existing city, or it could be built in a brand new "greenfield" site.

### <a name="how_much"></a>How much would it cost?

  * **The same as a regular city**
    * Construction costs, per square foot, would be about the same for buildings in a kinematic city as buildings in a regular city.
    * In a region with high construction costs, like California, constructing buildings in a kinematic city would be just as expensive as constructing buildings in other cities.
    * In places with lower construction costs, like the UAE, or China, constructing buildings in a kinematic city would cost about the same as building any other building. 
    
  * **Maybe slightly cheaper**
    * The simplest sorts of kinematic city designs could entirely omit some of the expensive transit systems found in conventional cities, such as subway systems and light rail. 
    * A simple kinematic city designs could also be composed entirely of mid-rise buildings, which are cheaper to build, per square foot, than either high-rise or low-rise buildings.

### <a name="how_long"></a>How long would it take?

  * **The same as regular construction**

### <a name="need"></a>Do we need new cities?

  * **Yes.** "Half of the urban area that will be needed [by 2050] hasn't been built yet."[^growth]
  * Here's more about [unmet need](../need)

## <a name="notes"></a>Notes for Chapter 2

### <a name="size"></a>Size & density

  * **Bigger may not be better.** Big cities, with more people, have more destinations to go to, and have a wider variety of destinatations. But, if there's too much congestion, it may take too long to get to the other side of town, so that limits your kinematic range. Your range doesn't cover the whole city, just the region of the city that's within 30 minutes of you.
  * **Denser may not be better.** New York is much denser than Los Angeles, so there are more destinations per square mile in New York than there are in Los Angeles. But it takes longer to travel 10 miles in New York than in does in Los Angeles, so Los Angeles actually has a larger kinematic range than New York.

### <a name="rules_of_thumb"></a>Rules of thumb

  * **People tend to travel about one hour a day.**
    * For people who commute, the average commute is about 30 minutes each way.
    * For people who aren’t commuting, it is common to spend about an hour each day on other sorts of trips: chores, errands, appointments, etc.
    * This "one hour per day" number has been found to be surprisingly consistent across different cities in different centuries, different cultures, and different continents, regardless of the different modes of travel used to commute. This is called the **Marchetti constant** (named for Cesare Marchetti, although it was really Yacov Zahavi who first wrote about it).
  * **Some aspects of a city scale linearly.**
    * If a city doubles in population size, many measurable characteristics of the city, such as the number of businesses, also double in size. Around the world, from small towns to big cities, regardless of the size of city, there's always about one business establishment per 22 people, and an average of about 8 employees for each establishment.
  * **Some aspects of a city scale sub-linearly.**
    * There are often economies of scale in the infrastructure of big cities (or at least, economies of density). 
    * If a city doubles in population size, meaning it grows by 100%, parts of the supporting infrastructure tend to only grow by 85%. This is tends to be true for networks of roads, electrical cables, and municipal sewers and water pipes.
  * **Some aspects of a city scale super-linearly.**
    *
