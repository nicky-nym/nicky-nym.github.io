## Summary

 1. The world [needs new cities](#need).
 1. There is [money available](#money) for new cities.
 1. People are [rapidly building new cities](#precident).
 1. Building new cities is a [cost-effective](#cost-effective) way to pull people out of poverty, bring economic growth, and meet basic needs.
 1. The cities we are building are not nearly as well designed as they could be, resulting in a **staggering opportunity cost**.

## Propinquitous cities
 
 1. Propinquitous cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's **mobilty**, and opporuntity, within the city.
 1. The improved mobility results from unconventional design choices
    * **transportation choices**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
    * **geometry choices**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * **vertical access choices**: stairs, elevators, and esclators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

## Benefits of pinq cities

 * Propinquitous cities: 
   1. should be **more affordable** to build than conventional cities
   1. should have **lower operating costs**
   1. should be **safer** and more fun to live in
   1. should have a **smaller carbon footprint** per capita
   1. could be established as **charter cities**

## <a name="need"></a>The world needs new cities

By 2050, it is estimated that
* **68% of the world's population** will be living in cities[^growth]
* about **2.5 billion additional people** will live in cities (vs. 2019), with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* about **200 million climate migrants** will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants] 

Half of the urban area that will be needed by 2050 hasnt been built yet.[^growth]

> "we're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"
>
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

As of 2018, **70 million people** were currently displaced by war, persecution and conflict. Of the total, 51 million were Internally Displaced People (IDPs), and 26 million were refugees (including **13 million refugee children**). Most refugees live in towns and cities, not rural areas or refugee camps. Nearly 4 in every 5 refugees are in displacement situations that have lasted for at least five years.[^displaced]

## <a name="money"></a>There is money available for new cities

> "The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. 
> Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of **$100bn** (£78bn), 
> while the country’s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. 
> Malaysia's Forest City had its price initially pegged at **$100bn**, 
> while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking **$161bn**. Adding up the costs of 
> more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment 
> that can be measured in the **trillions of dollars**."[^growth]
> 
> &mdash; Wade Shepard, author and columnist

11,000 new buildings are built every day.[^metabuild]

In 2019, U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for **$40 billion** in subsidies, grants, and loans for people in coastal communities who want to either move inland or elevate their homes.[^yang]

## <a name="precident"></a>People are rapidly building new cities

More than 120 new cities are currently being built in 40 nations around the world.[^growth]



## <a name="cost-effective"></a>Building new cities is cost-effective

TODO:

## The cities we are building are not nearly as well designed as they could be, resulting in a **staggering opportunity cost**.

> "If we stick to business as usual most of it is going to be 
> disorderly and less functional than the stuff we already have."[^growth]
> 
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

> "If you build a new city you don't have to relocate or work 
> around existing roads or rivers or factories or houses. 
> You also don’t have to work around existing political processes, 
> community groups, civic organisations ... or even existing 
> regulations and rules."[^growth]
