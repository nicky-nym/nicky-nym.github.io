## Summary

 1. The world [needs new cities](#need).
 1. There is [money available](#money) for new cities.
 1. People are [rapidly building new cities](#precident).
 1. Building new cities is a [cost-effective](#cost-effective) way to pull people out of poverty, bring economic growth, and meet basic needs.
 1. The cities we are building are not nearly as well designed as they could be, resulting in a **staggering opportunity cost**.

## Propinquitous cities
 
 1. Propinquitous cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's **mobilty**, and opporuntity, within the city.
 1. The improved mobility is the result of a few sets of unconventional design choices
    * **transportation choices**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
    * **geometry choices**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * **vertical access choices**: stairs, elevators, and esclators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

## Benefits

 * Propinquitous cities: 
   1. should be **more affordable** to build than conventional cities
   1. should have **lower operating costs**
   1. should be **safer** and more fun to live in
   1. should have a **smaller carbon footprint** per capita
   1. could be established as **charter cities**

## <a name="need"></a>The world needs new cities

By 2050, it is estimated that
* 68% of the world’s population will be living in cities[^growth]
* about 2.5 billion more people will live in cities, with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* about 200 million climate migrants will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants] 

Half of the urban area that will be needed by 2050 hasnt been built yet.[^growth]

## <a name="money"></a>There is money available for new cities

In 2019, U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for $40 billion in subsidies, grants, and loans for people in coastal communities who want to either move inland or elevate their homes.[^yang]

## <a name="precident"></a>People are rapidly building new cities

More than 120 new cities are currently being built in 40 nations around the world.[^growth]



## <a name="cost-effective"></a>Building new cities is cost-effective

Induced demand
: if you add lanes to a freeway, it leads to more trips, not faster trips[^induced_demand]

&nbsp;

Jevons paradox
: as **X** gets faster (and cheaper), people use more **X**[^jevons]
 
<span> </span>

Marchetti constant
: people will commute about 30 minutes each way per day [Marchetti constant](marchetti)
  

pinq
: propinquitous
  

<a name="propinquity"></a>propinquity
