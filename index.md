<span style="font-size:24pt;">a recipe for designing <em>propinquitous<sup><a href="#propinquity">?</a></sup></em> cities</span>

---

## Summary

 1. The world needs new cities.
 1. The world is rapidly building new cities.
 1. Building new cities is a cost-effective way to pull people out of poverty, bring economic growth, and meet basic needs.
 1. The cities we are building are not nearly as well designed as they could be, and the size of the opportunity cost is staggering.

## Propinquitous cities
 
 1. Propinquitous cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's **mobilty**, and opporuntity, within the city.
 1. The improved mobility is the result of a few sets of unconventional design choices
    * **transportation choices**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
    * **geometry choices**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * **vertical access choices**: stairs, elevators, and esclators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

## Benefits

 * Propinquitous cities: 
   1. should be more affordable to build than conventional cities
   1. should have lower operating costs
   1. should be safer and more fun to live in
   1. should have a smaller carbon footprint per capita
   1. could be established as charter cities
