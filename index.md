---

## Summary

 1. The world **[needs new cities](#need)**.
 1. There is **[money available](#money)** for new cities.
 1. People are **[rapidly building new cities](#precident)**.
 1. Building new cities is a **[cost-effective](#cost-effective)** way to pull people out of poverty, bring economic growth, and meet basic needs.
 1. By making significantly better design choices, we could make new **[cities that work far better](#work-better)** for everyone.

## What is a propinquitous city?

"Propinquitous city" is a made-up name for a set of ideas about new ways to design cities. No one has yet built a propinquitous city.

 1. Propinquitous cities are cities designed to maximize everyone's **[mobility](#mobility)**, and opportunity, within the city.
 1. The improved mobility results from unconventional design choices
    * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
    * **[layout choices](#layout)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
    * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

## Could we build a propinquitous city?

**Yes.** The Pinq city plans are designed with existing technology in mind, and with an eye toward simple, affordable technologies. It's about bicycles and water pipes, not about floating ocean domes and orbital towers.

## Why build propinquitous cities?

If you're starting from scratch, then with a few good design choices it should be possible to build a city that **works far better** than normal conventional cities

* a propinquitous city: 
   1. should have **less traffic** congestion
   1. should have **more commute destinations**
   1. should **[thrive economically](#economics)** compared to similarly-sized normal cities
   1. should have **better air quality**
   1. should be **more affordable** to build than conventional cities
   1. should have **lower operating costs**
   1. should have **lower housing costs**, and potentially **no homelessness**
   1. should be **safer** and more fun to live in
   1. should have **better accessibility**
   1. should be more **kid-friendly**
   1. should be more **elder-friendly**
   1. should have a **smaller carbon footprint** per capita
   1. should be **more resiliant** after a natural disaster or other emergency
   1. could be established as **charter cities**[^mason]

## What would it take to build a propinquitous city?

Rome wasn't built in a day. Building a propinquitous city would take a long time and lot of resources:
  * miles of empty land, clear of conservation restrictions and legal show-stoppers 
  * local government support, and local popular support among the neighbors
  * billions of dollars of start-up capital
  * millions of pounds of steel and concrete, and hundreds of construction teams 
  * a population of people willing to move into the new housing as it is completed
  * a population of companies willing to move into new office space as it is completed

## Could we turn London or Paris into propinquitous cities?

**No.** Existing cities have a lot of physical infrastructure that's expensive to change. People can make incremental changes, like adding new roads or bridges, but it's not practical to change the fundamental layout of an existing city.

## Could propinquitous ideas trickle down to existing cities? 

**Yes.** Over time people in existing cities like New York and San Francisco could adopt some of the ideas in the propinquitous designs, and make their cities incrementally more propinquitous, even if they can't change the fundamental layouts.

## Democracy and governance

A propinquitous city could have a traditional city government structure, or it could experiment with less conventional structures. That's a big topic, and one for another author. Suffice it to say, the questions of governance are largely orthogonal to the ideas presented here about the physical layout of a city, the transportation choices, etc. An authoritarian government could build a propinquitous city, or a utopian libertarian collective could build a propinquitous city, and they would both be propinquitous cities.

## <a name="need"></a>(1) The world needs new cities

By 2050, it is estimated that
* **68% of the world's population** will be living in cities[^growth]
* about **2.5 billion additional people** will live in cities (vs. 2019), with 90% of the uptake in Asia and Africa[^growth]
* about **200 million climate migrants** will settle in new locations. (Forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion.)[^migrants] 

Half of the urban area that will be needed by 2050 hasnt been built yet.[^growth]

> "we're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth"
>
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

As of 2018, **70 million people** were currently displaced by war, persecution and conflict. Of the total, 51 million were Internally Displaced People (IDPs), and 26 million were refugees (including **13 million refugee children**). Most refugees live in towns and cities, not rural areas or refugee camps. Nearly 4 in every 5 refugees are in displacement situations that have lasted for at least five years.[^displaced]


## <a name="money"></a>(2) There is money available for new cities

> "The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. 
> Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of **$100bn** (£78bn), 
> while the country’s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. 
> Malaysia's Forest City had its price initially pegged at **$100bn**, 
> while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking **$161bn**. Adding up the costs of 
> more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment 
> that can be measured in the **trillions of dollars**."[^growth]
> 
> &mdash; Wade Shepard, author and columnist

In 2019, U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang called for **$40 billion** in subsidies, grants, and loans for people in coastal communities who want to either move inland or elevate their homes.[^yang]

### Large private sector projects

In recent decades we have begun to see the private sector take on very large scale projects, without government funding.

City Center, in Las Vegas Nevada, is a good example
  * 17 million square feet of mixed use space
  * built in 4 years (2006 to 2010)
  * 100% privately financed, at a cost of **$11 billion** <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Banks, real estate developers, and the construction industry are now operating at a level where they can coordinate the successful delivery of very large projects.

In the 2020s and 2030s, is will not be crazy to propose a $20 billion privately funded construction project. The project just needs to pencil out well, be low risk, and meet the needs of customers.


## <a name="precident"></a>(3) People are rapidly building new cities

More than **120 new cities** are currently being built in 40 nations around the world.[^growth]

11,000 new buildings are built every day &mdash; **4 million new buildings a year** [^metabuild]


## <a name="cost-effective"></a>(4) Building new cities is cost-effective

Projects in existing cities can be staggerly expensive.
  * $4.5 billion for the San Francisco Transbay Transit Center & Salesforce Tower <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $17 billion for the 2nd Avenue Subway project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $20 billion for the Hudson Yards project in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $21 billion for the Big Dig in Boston <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $23 billion for the Riyadh Metro <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
  * $32 billion to rebuild the World Trade Center in New York <sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Building on a new empty, greenfield site is a lot less expensive than building in an existing city. 
  * [TODO: examples]

New cities provide more space at lower cost per capita.
  * [TODO: examples]

New cities create value, and demand.

## <a name="work-better"></a>(5) We can make cities that work far better

> "If we stick to business as usual most of it is going to be 
> disorderly and less functional than the stuff we already have."[^growth]
> 
> &mdash; Paul Romer, Nobel prize-winning economist, New York University.

> "If you build a new city you don't have to relocate or work 
> around existing roads or rivers or factories or houses. 
> You also don’t have to work around existing political processes, 
> community groups, civic organisations ... or even existing 
> regulations and rules."[^growth]
> 
> &mdash; John Macomber, senior lecturer, Harvard Business School.


### <a name="economics"></a>Economic prosperity

Cities should provide **economic prosperity** for the people who live in them and the people who have offices there.

> "Once one starts to think about (the causes of economic growth),
> it is hard to think about anything else."
>
> &mdash; Robert Lucas, Nobel laureate in Economics

* [Arteries](arteries)

### <a name="economics"></a>Social prosperity

Cities should provide **social prosperity** for the people who live there. It should be:
  * easy to go see your friends
  * easy to do an errand for your mom
  * easy to go to weird new clubs and meetup groups to see who's there

To make those things easy, the city needs to provide good **[mobility](#mobility)**:
  * safe travel from anywhere to anywhere, by anyone
  * fast travel times
  * cheap travel costs

## <a name="mobility"></a>(6) Mobility

To provide good **mobility** the city needs to ensure:
  * safe travel from anywhere to anywhere, by anyone
  * fast travel times
  * cheap travel modes

Good mobility is more important than it sounds. It's not just about making rush-hour traffic a little less tiresome. Good mobility actually has significant implications for:
  * economic prosperity
  * social prosperity

Improved mobility results from unconventional design choices:
  * **[transportation choices](#transportation)**: what vehicles to use to move people and packages &mdash; cars and trucks vs. small low-power vehicles
  * **[geometry choices](#geometry)**: the size and shape of city features &mdash; building heights, block sizes, and street lane widths
  * **[elevator choices](#elevator)**: stairs, elevators, and escalators vs. flights of wheelchair ramps

## <a name="transportation"></a>(7) Transportation design choices

The propinquitous city recipe calls for:
  * no subways
  * no light rail
  * no trollies or trams
  * no mass transit
  * no cars
  * no self-driving cars
  * no busses
  * no trucks
  * no taxis
  * no ubers, lyfts, waymos
  * no motorcycles
  * no gas engines
  * no open roads

Instead, we have
  * rain-sheltered pedestrian sidewalks
  * rain-sheltered bike lanes for narrow, low-power, modest-speed vehicles
    * segways
    * mopeds (electric)
    * bicycles
    * cargo trikes
    * scooters
    * skateboards
  
## <a name="layout"></a>(8) Layout design choices

The propinquitous city recipe calls for:
  * no single-story ranch houses and no other single-story buildings
  * no skyscrapers and no high rises
  * no suburban sprawl
  * no highways
  * no roads with lanes wide enough for cars and trucks

Instead, we have: 
  * mid-rise buildings of about six stories, similar to Paris
  * roads with narrow lanes for narrow vehicles
  * density of 

## <a name="elevator"></a>(9) Elevator design choices

The propinquitous city design recipe calls for:
  * no elevators
  * no stairs
  * no escalators

The only way to go "upstairs" or "downstairs" in a pinq city is by using
  * sloped hallways
  * sloped sidewalks
  * sloped bike paths
  * flights of wheelchair ramps

This idea sounds crazy to most people when they first hear it, because it's so different from all the normal buildings and cities that we're used to.

However, if you run the numbers, and run simulations, it turns out that getting rid of elevators and stairs works out just fine. Instead of making it harder to get places, having no elevators makes it **faster** to get between any two random locations. Plus this design is greener, works better after a natural disaster, can be built more quickly, is less expensive to build, and is less expensive to maintain.

## Glossary

* **charter city**
  * a special jurisdiction with a blank slate in commercial law, to allow for the adoption of new practices in areas such as a business registration, labor law, tax administration, and commercial dispute resolution
  * _typically built on greenfield sites to avoid the challenges of implementing such a wide array of reforms in an existing polity_
  * _typically privately finanaced_

* **effective altruism**
  * using empirical analysis to direct resources towards efforts that do the most possible good
  * _anti-malaria efforts, deworming initiatives1, and direct cash transfer programs are among the interventions most widely credited with providing the most cost-effective improvement in welfare for the global poor than any other intervention_
