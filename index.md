<a name="summary"></a>The Impossible City design hinges on a basic re-design of what a city street could look like. 

In the Impossible design, we:
  * replace cars & buses with **bicycles** & **bike-sized** vehicles
  * replace stop signs and traffic lights with **grade-separated** intersections
  * replace outdoor streets with **sheltered streets**

The result is:
  * less congestion and **twice the throughput**
  * **50% annual cost savings** over conventional public transit and private car ownership
  * **lower carbon emissions**, quieter streets, and less air polution
  * **more trees**
  * a bit more available floorspace
